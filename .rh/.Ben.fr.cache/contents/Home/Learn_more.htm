  Why is SCM best suited to local swimming clubs?
  Your local swimming club differs from a large competitive event in many ways.
  Typically a local swim club look like this ...
  Nominations for events happens at the pool gate. Parents are egar to get the night's event started so they can get the kids home and to bed, but the night start's slowly, there's a cue to nominate.
  Most club's have small membership numbers, say 50-100 swimmers, so it's normal to mix gender and ages into individual heats.   
  Parents are given the jobs of timekeepers or marshalls. And someone is sitting in a corner, entering racetimes, probably into a spread sheet. There's lots of paper being couried around the pool.
  Meanwhile at the professional swimming event ...
  Electronic timing, electronic billboards, quarter finals, semi finals, a hoard of timekeeps and lots of officials. 
  What's really needed
  
    Quickly get members nominated.
    Remove printer ink and paper.
    A single button to assign swimmers to events. 
    Collect timekeeper's race-times easily.
    Store and archive some basic member's details. (name, age, gender and swimming history.)
    Tabulate a report of the night's session .
  
   
  SCM's charter.
  SCM is focused on 'what is needed' and most importantly, keep it simple. 
  Just getting started .... (I have just the one computer)
  SwimClubMeet is the core app - it does it all. It creates sessions and events, nominate and Auto-Builds all your heats, enter race-times. It also manages members details. It does reporting.  
  It'll print-out all the forms you need. Such as the Marshall's rally sheet and Timekeeper's entry sheet. At the end of the night you can create a session report for distribution to parent and friends.
  If you have the resources ... Wi-Fi, more than one computer (touch screen?) 
  Got two computers and a hub or wi-fi. Connect the two, share the SQL server and run SwimClubMeet on both. Nominate swimmers twice as fast.
  Go one step further ...
  Then there's the support applications.
  
  SCM gives you a simple kiosk type app for members to self-nominate at the entry gate.
  You may wish to use the Marshall and Timekeeper apps for a paperless club night. (Designed for MS Surface PRO)
  A LeaderBoard app to track swimmer and house scores. (for you club's end-of-season finals).
  In development
  A stand-alone app just to manage membership data, should you wish to delegate tasks.
  A pre-nominate app that uses email and PDF dataforms. Fully automated.
  Future ideas and plans
   
  
    A statistical package. Lots of charts and stats, for the annual committee meeting.
    A 'Carnival' application to make it easy for neighboring clubs to challenge each other to a 'swim-off'.
    A 'Report's' package for some additional forms, for example, barcoded membership cards, creditation and podium certificates, etc.
    Android versions of nominate, marshall and timekeeper apps.
