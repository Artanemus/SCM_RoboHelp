  New Session Dialogue
  This dialogue makes entering dates and times for your new session a little bit easier. It access from session table. Right mouse click to show the context sensitive popup menu then select New Session. Or use the menu bar, Session > New Session. If you have focus on the session table, then you can also use the keyboard short-cut CTRL-INS.
  The session description can be 256 characters long, but it's best to keep it brief. Perhaps a short note on the weather for that night? This description appears in reports and other dialogues. Session descriptions are optional.
  Press post to create the new session.
  Press cancel to exit the dialogue without making changes.
  A new session position in the table is determined by it's date. The most recent sessions are placed at the top of the table. 
  If the session table is incorrectly ordered (unlikely), press the refresh button to re-sort.
