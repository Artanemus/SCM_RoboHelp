  Quick Pick Nominee
  Only nominee's that have nominated for the event and haven't been given a lane are shown in this dialogue.
  Personal Best and TimeToBeat are calculated 'on-the-fly'. The times shown are based on data that pre-dates the current selected session. Personal Best will be empty if the nominee hasn't previously swum the event. TimeToBeat will be empty if there is insufficient data.
  Click on a column heading to sort on that column. Click again to invert the sort.
  The dialogue also includes a search textbox to filter the list. This uses wildcards. You only need to type a 'snippet'. It filters the list as you type.
  By default names are described lastname, firstname. This can be switched by  pressing the toggle-name button.
  This dialogue will be empty if all nominees have been placed (they have a swimming lane).
  The information found here should assist you in manually building a heat.
  Note the title bar reads Nominees, the first column's is titled Nominees.

  Quick Pick Member
  Lists all active members (who are active and swim), EXCLUDING those that are currently assigned a lane in the current event.  
  All the notes for the nominee dialogue pertain to this dialogue.
  Just one important note. When you select a member from this list, that member will become a nominee for the event AND an entrant.
  A possible reason to use the 'Quick Pick Member' method is : A member in your club has arrived very late. Nominations for events have closed but they want to swim this event. Using this method you perform both nomination and assign them a lane. With the ability to see their racetimes, you can pick the right heat/lane for them ... all this without performing an auto-build.
  This list can be large. Larger than the nominee's list.
  Note the title bar reads Active Members, the first column is titled Members' Name.
