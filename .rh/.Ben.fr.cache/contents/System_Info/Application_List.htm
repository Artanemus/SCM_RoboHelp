  Standalone Applications bundled with SCM 
  Notes on standalone applications. These applications have been written in a cross platform compiler. It's intended that in future releases there will be Linix, Mac, iPhone, Android and iPad variants of these applications. If you share your 'Server' over wi-fi then 'collectively' these remote applications perform all the features that the core application can do.
  
    SCM_Nominate, Beta.
        
        This is a stand alone application.. This application allows members to quickly nominate for the 'nights' events. It's like a kiosk -  swimmers enter their membership number and then nominate for the listed events.
        
        Set up a couple of tablets at the frount gate for quick event nomination. 
       
    SCM_Marshall, Beta.
      
      This is a stand alone application. This application lets your lane marshall to browse events and heats. Displays entrants, their lane numbers and racetime (once they have been entered by Admin or TimeKeeper) . The marshall can also flag a heat as 'raced'. 
       
    SCM_TimeKeeper, Beta.
      
      This is a stand alone application. This application lets your timekeepers track events, heats for their assigned lane. It shows the entrant name, timetobet and personal best for the assign lane. The timekeeper may enter the race time for the entrant which is then sent to the server. 
        
        Or set the roaming feature on. This enabled one "Grand' Timekeeper Official to collect each lane's time for each heat run.
      
    SCM_LeaderBoard, Beta.
      
      This is a windows 10 only, stand alone application. It uses a local SQLiteV3 to optimise performance and remove the load off the core MSSQL Server. This application allows you to track member, house and event scores, in real time. It includes a report system. Use this application to track scores for your end-of-season finals. May serve as a billboard.
