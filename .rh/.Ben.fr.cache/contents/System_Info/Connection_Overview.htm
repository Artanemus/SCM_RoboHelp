  Connection Overview
  Here is a visual guide to connecting the SCM applications and an overview of system settings. 
  Ideally three computers would be a good start. 2 computers with touch screens (Microsoft edge pro) and a 'pimp-out' computer (a lap top with 4-8MG of RAM - intel i7) to run the server and core SCM application.
  Perhaps a fourth computer to run SCM_Member or a 2nd instance of the core application - to answer/update members queries/details and add new members.
