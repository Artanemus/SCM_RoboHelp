  Use Window's default theme.
  By default SCM uses a Dark theme as this is more suited to swimming pool lighting conditions. However, should you wish to use your local theme running on your PC, then check this box.  Below is an example where the default theme was restored - wit,  the default install theme.

  When checked SCM will add a 'generic' event description each time a new event is added. These descriptions can be later edited.
