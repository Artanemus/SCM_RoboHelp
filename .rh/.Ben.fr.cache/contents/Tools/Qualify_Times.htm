  Qualify Times
  What are qualification times?
  Qualification Times (QT) are the minimum swimming times allowed for a given distance and stroke.
  A swimmer must be able to complete the event within the QT, else the swimmer is ineligible to swim that event.
  QT are age and gender specific.
  SCM uses seperate QT tabels for short and long course. What table you see is dependant on your clubs length of pool settings.  Pools 30.4m or less (33yards) are considered short courses.
  SCM requires all genders to be entered.
  
  Where are qualification times used in SCM?
  When you nominate an entrant you have the option to turn on the 'qualifyied' button, or 'Q' button. The letter 'Q' appears next to each event a club member is qualified to swim. Qualification is flagged in the Nominate support app. Also the pre-nomination flags qualification when it emails each members a PDF nomination form. Various reports display the qualification status of members.
  Keyboard Short-cuts.
  cntrl-DEL for delete record.
  cntrl-Ins to insert a new record.
  Other bits.
  Most swimming clubs don't use qualification times for 25m events. 25m events are open to all swimmers. I guess you would need a 15m trial distance to make a 25m qualification record?
