          The first 32 places can be given a score.
          (If in setup score is set to EVENT - ABSOLUTE, then in an event that has 4 heats with 8 swimmers, all swimmers will be given a score.)
          Tenth of a point are allowed. Using tenths, can makes for better competition.
          Leave the field empty (00.0) for a place to be unscored.
          If in setup you have selected to score only heats, the number of pool lanes dictates the number of places SCM will scored. (Logical)
          Unplaced points ... unplaced swimmers are scored zero. In future version of SCM this option will be editable. 
        
      
    
  
   
  Divisions
  
  A division is an age range for a given gender. Ages are inclusive. The 'Age From' value must be less or equal to the 'Age To' value.
  Divisions are used when the score setup is RELATIVE.
  You may have division that form INTERSECTIONS, INCLUSIONS. 
  An example
  A .. Girl's 8 years (8-8)
    B .. Girl's 9 years (9-9)
    C ... Girl's 8-12 years (8-12)
  Both A and B are a subsets of C. (Division C holds the 'grand finalists' for the under 12 girl's.)
  Members in this example will be scored twice. These scorings will be delineated in reports, as each member's scores will be described with the division that derived the score.
  LeaderBoard
  
  Pressing Update will refresh the leaderboard display.
  What the leaderboard displays is determined by your setting in the preceeding tabsheets (wit. SetUp, Score and Division).
  IMPORTANT : Only events that are CLOSED are scored.
  WARNING : Dead heats are score incorrectly. In future versions of SCM this will be fixed.
  NOTE: the description text in the top header that describes the setup that produced the display.
  To print the leaderboard go to the report tabsheet.
