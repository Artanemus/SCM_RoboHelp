The 'image.png' can be anything you like, but should be square. If it isn't that should also be the first step in the above.
You can also include larger resolutions such as 128 or 256 pixels, but few browsers would make use of them. 
The 16 and 32 pixel sizes are much more commonly used in such ICO files so special emphesis on those my be useful. 
Also remember that many browsers will color reduce the images so are to reduce the space used to store it in an users bookmarks file.

convert image.png -alpha off -resize 256x256 \
          -define icon:auto-resize="256,128,96,64,48,32,16" \
          favicon.ico
