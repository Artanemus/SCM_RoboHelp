In the moment that the Auto-Build button is pressed, all TTBs are calculated for all nominees for the given event, in real time.

A new member, without a race history, may be incorrectly place for the first instance but once a race has been swum and their racetime data is entered, that member will always be placed correctly.","\n  "," ","\n  ","If you want to 'kick-start' your TimeToBet algorithm (you have just installed the application and you have no data) then you could add a session that is dated prior to the new swimming season.

That way when the first club night is played ... entrants are correctly placed.","\n  "," ","\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n\n"]],"4":[["TimeToBeat How it works"]],"id":"45"})
