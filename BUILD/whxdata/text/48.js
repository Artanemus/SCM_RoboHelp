The order for an eight lane pool goes something like this .... 4,5,3,6,2,7,1,8. The algorithm used in SCM will correctly scatter for any sized pool. Even pools with an odd number of lanes.","\n  ","Consider this ...","\n  ","\n  ","Each square represents a swimmer. Fastest swimmer is green, intermediate yellow, slowest red. A total of 32 swimmers will require four heats in an eight lane pool.","\n  "],["\n  ","\n  ","The illustrate shows that the all top eight fastest swimmers have been placed in heat four. All the slowest swimmers are in the heat one.","\n  "],["\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","Circle seeding is selected.","\n          ","In this example the seed depth will be set to two. This means the two fastest heats, three and four, will be circle seed.","\n          ","The heats one and two will use the default seed method.","\n        ","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n  ","Note: SwimClubMeet first builds a stack of swimmers, fastest to slowest. Calculates the number of heats and count of swimmers needed. Then it builds heats, fastest to slowest. Hence circle seeding is top down.","\n  ","\n  ","It can be seen that there is now a 'spread' of fastest swimmers in heats four and three. Your fastest swimmer is in heat four. the second fastest swimmer in heat three. They both are given lane four.","\n  ","Perchance - entrant placement in heats two and one are identical to the previous default seeding.","\n  "],["\n  ","When you have many entrants to an event (say four or five heats) you may want to circle seed to improve the racing experience for your top contenders.","\n  ","It's recommended that you don't exceed a depth of three. The racing experience (a club level) for bottom ranked swimmers isn't improved if you go beyond three. ","\n  "],["\n  ","When creating a 'FINAL' the default seeding is used.
