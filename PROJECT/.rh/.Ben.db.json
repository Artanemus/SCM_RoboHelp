For example, when using the Nominate, Marshall and Timekeeper applications. Remote access will require a user name and password.\n  \nIf 'Use OS Authentication' is checked then the users Windows login will be used.

Use the Club Members button and add your members.\n      \n      Get yourself comfortable, this is going to take some time. Good news - you only do this once. Minimum requirements are FirstName, LastName, DOB and Gender.\n      \n       \n    \n    Add a new \"Session\" in the \"Session Table\". With that session selected ...\n        \n        TIP: A short note makes the session memorable. eg.'Clear skies and bar-b-que'.\n      \n       \n    \n    Add your events into the \"Events Table\" by entering \"Distance\" and \"Stroke\". \n      \n      If you need to describe your events. Click the Expander button to expand the event grid. The 'description' column is now visible. Any text entered here will be seen by everyone and displayed in every report.\n      \n       \n    \n    Select the next tab-sheet - Nominate. Here you select the swimmer then check the events they will be swimming.\n      \n      If you need to know if they are 'Qualified' to swim the event. Toggle the 'Qualified' button on.\n      \n       \n    \n    Select the next tab-sheet - Heats. Press the Build Heats button for each event. Be aware, your database, at this stage, is totally empty. So your swimmers will not be 'matched-up' correctly. (See the special note below.) \n      \n      TIP: There's a 'build all heats' in the menu bar.\n      \n       \n    \n    You are ready to print the marshal and time-keepers' forms.\n      \n      TIP: If the 'print-set' button isn't enough, there's a 'print all marshal and timekeeper forms' in the menu bar. But beware, the windows print spooler is probably turned on and that's a lot of printer jobs! \n      \n       \n    \n    When a heat has been swum - enter the swimmers' times into the \"race time'' column.\n      \n      Use the arrow-down or tab-key to move to the next race time.\n      \n       \n    \n    When the session is completed, print the session report to PDF and email.\n      \n      TIP: Check-out the 'qualified swimmers report' in tools >> qualification times... >> reports. \n    \n  \n  That it. \n  Here's a link to a YouTube Video that takes you through the above process in detail.\n  Special note:\n      If you want to 'kick-start' your TimeToBet algorithm (you have just installed the application and you have no race data) add a new session that is dated prior to the new swimming season. Populate that session with every type of event. Then fill selected events with the personal best race-times for each of your members. That way when the very first SCM club night is played ... entrants are correctly placed.

Just fill with swimmers using the ellipse menu button.  See  \nEntrant's table for more details on building heats manually.\n  \nThe number of lanes created is determined by the \nNumber Of Swimming Lanes preference, found in the options menu.\n  \nAnother way to create new heats is to use \nAuto-Build Heats.\n  \n\nDelete Heat\n  \n\nDelete the heat.

A selection box appears around the CELL.\n  \n\n\n  \nClick the cell once more. Doing so has set the CELL to edit mode. Another way to enter edit mode is to use the keyboard short-cut \nf2. Yet another way is to use the \nenter key.\n  \n\n\n  \nNotice, you can't edit the swimmers name. The only active part is the \nellipse button, which is located at the far end of the CELL.\n  \n\nEllipse button. Method 1.\n  \n\n\nLeft mouse click the \nellipse button to open the \nQuick Pick Nominee dialogue.\n  \n\nFor this event ...\n  \n\n\n  \nThe swimmers shown in the list are all \nnominees that \nhaven't been given a lane. \n  \nIf the list is empty, then ever swimmer that nominated has a lane.\n  \nClicking a column heading will sort by that column. Click again will invert the sort order.\n  \nIf the list is very long, then use the search editbox to narrow it down. It used wildcards, so you only need to enter a part or snippet of a nominee's name. It reacts in real time to your key strokes. To see the full list again, clear the search editbox.\n  \nThe \nTimeToBeat, age and gender give you useful information on whom to pick, when manually constructing a heat.\n  \n\nDouble click on the chosen record to place the nominee into the lane. Else click the \npost button. As expected, the \ncancel button closes the dialogue without any changes being made.\n  \nIf you are re-assigning swimmers. Then the swimmer who has been 'bumped' out of their lane is returned to the nominees list, awaiting a lane assignment.\n  \nThe process works on blank lanes - you can fill a blank lane with a nominee. But to empty a lane of it's entrant, use the \nempty lane button.\n  \nOnce the assignment is done and the dialogue closes, to exit 'edit mode', either \ntab or \nclick outside the CELL. Exiting edit-mode finalizes the change.\n  \n\nEllipse button. Method 2.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nCntrl-left mouse click the cell's \nEllipse button to open the \nQuick Pick Member dialogue.\n  \nThe dialogue is very simular. Note the title on the caption bar is different, and list is significantly larger.\n  \n\nAll active club \nmembers who swim appear in this list. With the \nexception of swimmers who have been given a lane in the event. \n  \nFunctionality is identical to the previous dialogue.\n  \nThe magic done here is this... if you assign a member to a lane then you have also \nnominated that member for the event. 'Two birds with one stone'. You created both a nominee and an entrant.\n  \n\nMoving Entrants \n  \n\n\nTo move entrants to a different lane, select the lane with the entrant you wish to move, click the \narrow up or \narrow down buttons. This works for empty lanes too.\n  \nTo move an entrant into the previous or next heat, continue pressing the \narrow up or \narrow down buttons.\n  \nThe keyboard short-cuts are \nctrl-up and \nctrl-down.\n  \nUs the\n Switch Lanes button as an alternative method to swap an entrant between lanes and events. \n  \nMore entrant table columns.\n  \n\nLane#\n  \nA read-only CELL. The pool's lane number. The number of lanes that appears in the table is determined by \n  \n\nTools ... \nOptions ... \nClub ... \nNumber of lanes  \n  \nrace time\n  \nIt's in this CELL that you enter a swimmer's time for racing the event.\n  \nSelect the CELL by \nTab or \nmouse click, a selection box appears arround the CELL.\n  \n\n\n  \nPress \nenter or \nClick the cell once more. Doing so has set the CELL to edit mode. Yet another way to enter edit mode is to use the keyboard short-cut \nf2.\n  \n\nThis CELL uses a template to assist you in entering time. The  '\n:', '\n.' characters cannot be type over. Use the \nleft and \nright arrow keys to navigate. \nDouble click to select all.\n  \nThe quickest method to entering race times is to select all, then start typing. If you want to enter 31 seconds and 41/100ths, do this, type 003141. There is no need to type the '\n:', '\n.' characters.\n  \nEntering an invalid time, for example 01:62.20, will be ignored. You can't have 62 seconds! The race time will revert when you exit edit-mode - ignoring your erronous entry. Note: you aren't prompted with an error message. Double check your race times.\n  \nTo finalize your changes, exit edit-mode by pressing \ntab or \nenter or \narrow up or \narrow down or \nclick outside the CELL.\n  \nTo clear a race time, select all and press the \nbackspace key. The race time will be set to zero. When you exit edit-mode the CELL will be painted blank.\n  \nThe TimeKeepers application can set a swimmer's race time remotely.\n  \n\nMost human timekeepers aren't the best at recording 1000ths. The reason SwimClubMeet accepts this precision is to prepare itself for electronic touch-pads. A future addition.\n  \n\nTODO: race time additional keyboard short-cuts : CTRL-A select all. CTRL-C copy to clipboard. CTRL-P paste from clipboard. CTRL-X cut (clear) race time. Warning message or visual indicator for illegal race times.\n  \n\nTimeToBeat\n  \nThis is a read only calculated field. \nSCM  has determined that the entrant will most likely swim the event in this time (based on historical data).\n  \nAuto-Create Heats usesTimeToBeat to build a list of swimmers, ordered fastest to lowest.  Swimmers without a TTB will be placed in the slowest heat. If you would like to know more about how TTB works, then follow this \nlink.\n  \n\nPersonalBest \n  \nThis is a read only calculated field. The Personal Best (\nPB) is an entrants best race time achieved for the event - up to but excluding the current session.\n  \n\nD\n  \nIf checked this indicates the entrant has been disqualified by the race marshall. The Marshall's application can set this remotely.\n  \n\nS\n  \nIf checked this indicates the entrant was scratched from the event.

The more data the better.\n  \n\n\nTimeToBeat is always calculated based on the events swum up to but excluding the current session. Data outside of these bounds is ignored.\n  \n\n\nTimeToBeat is calculated actively, in real time. By default it uses the average of the 3 fastest times the member has swum. Alternatively it can use the last known race time or the member's personal best .\n  \nIf a member doesn't have any \nrace time data, then a time is calculated based on the mean average of the bottom 50% (default), with consideration to age and gender. If there is still insufficient data it'll ignore gender. It there is still not enough data (default:  at least 4 records) then it will re-calculate, doing an age spread (default: plus or minus 1 year).\n  \nIf after all this process time, a suitable race time can't be found, then the \nTimeToBeat is left empty. (For an Auto-Build Heats, this effectively sends that swimmer to the slowest heats.)\n  \nThis algorithm can be set in \n\nTools - \nOptions - \n\nTTB \n\n.\n  \nAlso, 'on-the-fly', when doing an Auto-Build Heats \n\n.\n  \n \n  \n\nNotes for Auto-Build Heats:\n  \n\nTimeToBeat is used to select the heat and lane that a member will be given. In the moment that the Auto-Build button is pressed, all TTBs are calculated for all nominees for the given event, in real time. The data used is all the race times of all members that pre-dates the selected session. The TTB data is used to build a list of entrants, fastest to slowest. Those without a T\nTB will end at the bottom of this list and placed \ninto the slowest heat. A new member, without a race history, may be incorrectly place for the first instance but once a race has been swum and their race time data is entered, that member will always be placed correctly.\n  \n \n  \n\nIf you want to 'kick-start' your TimeToBet algorithm (you have just installed the application and you have no data) then you could add a session that is dated prior to the new swimming season. Populate that session with events, filled with the personal best times for all of your members.

The 'lease time' can be hours or 'forever'. Consider setting the lease time for computer with the MS SQL server to 'forever'. That way the login IP address will always be same. \n  As each router is different, sorry no help session, instead refer to your router's manual..\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/ConnectingSCM.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/ConnectingSCM.png"}],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Author":"Ben Ambrose","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Title":"Connection Overview","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Description":"Schematic ","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::InnerText":"\n  Connection Overview\n  Here is a visual guide to connecting the SCM applications and an overview of system settings. \n  Ideally three computers would be a good start. 2 computers with touch screens (Microsoft edge pro) and a 'pimp-out' computer (a lap top with 4-8MG of RAM -

The entrant's Time-To-Beat \n  You are given three options to calculate the time-to-beat for each entrant. These options require that the entrant have previously raced the event. ie. there is historical data. The default is 'Use the average of the 3 fastest race times'. Only data that pre-dates the current selected session is used.\n  2. Estimate a Time-To-Beat \n  This section of the dialogue can create a time-to-beat for an entrants with no historical race data.  By default, this is enabled. There is no good reason to disable this feature, other than to improve the DB Server performance.\n  The algorithm does this.\n  A. List all the swimmers of the same age and gender who have swum the event. Use only the bottom 50% and get the average time. If this fails (no data, or there is less than 4 swimmers) go to step B.\n  B. List all the swimmers of the same age - ignore gender ... rinse and repeat. If this fails go to step C.\n  C. List all the swimmers in an age bracket (currently set at : plus/minus 1 year) ... rinse and repeat. If this fails, step D.\n  D. Give this swimmer a race time of NULL. This swimmer will be placed in the slowest heat.\n  If you have a lot of data - many years of club nights - then it's time to tweak the percentage. I suggest dropping it over time to 30 percent. Typically, swimmers in untrialled events under-preform. Email me if I'm wrong.  \n  3. Special Options.\n  Seperate gender. For each gender, a list of entrants will be made, ordered fastest to slowest. Each list will be given seperate heats. eg. Split male and female into seperate heats. Said differently, boys don't race the girls.\n  Exclude gutter lanes. If checked, swimmers will not be placed in the outside lanes. eg. If you have an 8 lane pool - well now you have only 6. Helpful if you have ladders that protude in the side lanes.\n  4. Group by..\n  Another way to group entrants. Fine tune the stacking of entrant numbers across heats.\n  \n    Don't group ... disables group by.\n    Entrant's age ... swimmers with the same age are placed in the same heat. May produce a large amount of heats.\n    Membership type ... swimmers of the same membership type are placed in the same heat.\n  \n  5. Seed Method\n  A full description of seeding (with diagrams) is given here.\n  But in a 'nut-shell'.\n  SwimClubMeet (default). After filters and grouping, the resultant entrants are placed in a list fastest to slowest.  Fastest swimmers swim the last heat. Slowest are in the first heat.\n  For a eight lane pool - Swimmers are scattered as per Olymic Standards 4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 1, 8. Fastest swimmer swims lane 4. Slowest swimmer in lane 8.\n  Circle Seeding. Gets a little more complicated. Say you have 8 lanes and 4 heats. Your seed depth is 2.\n  After filters and grouping, the resultant entrants are placed in a list fastest to slowest. Fastest heat is heat 4. Slowest is heat 1.\n  Only heats 3 and 4 are circle seeded. Heats 1 and 2 use the default seeding.\n  The fastest swimmer goes into heat 4 lane 4. The 2nd Fastest swimmer is placed in heat 3 lane 4. The 3rd fastest is place in heat 4 lane 5. The fourth fastest is placed in heat 4 lane 5. And so on .... \n  Why use circle seeding? By mixing up the ranked swimmers, it'll change the racing dynamics and 'freshen-up' the competition. Just another reason why you want to go to 'Club Night'.\n  Circle seeding is best used on events with a large number of entrants. \n  Special Note.\n  Any changes made in this dialogue become the new default settings used by  SCM. Said differently - settings are mirrored in the Tool Options dialogue.\n  Learn more  ...\n  TTB is also mirrored in Options.   \n  Auto-Build is also mirrored in Options.  \n  Follow the link to a summary of TTB.    \n\n","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/SeedA.JPG","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SeedA.JPG"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/SeedB.JPG","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SeedB.JPG"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/SeedingD.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SeedingD.jpg"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/SeedC.JPG","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SeedC.JPG"}],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Title":"How seeding works","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::InnerText":"\n  How seeding works\n  Here's an illustrated explanation of seeding lanes.\n  Some ground rules.\n  Olympic standards determine which lanes competitors are scattered into. The order for an eight lane pool goes something like this .... 4,5,3,6,2,7,1,8. The algorithm used in SCM will correctly scatter for any sized pool. Even pools with an odd number of lanes.\n  Consider this ...\n  \n  Each square represents a swimmer. Fastest swimmer is green, intermediate yellow, slowest red. A total of 32 swimmers will require four heats in an eight lane pool.\n  Default seeding. (This algorithm is also used by 'Finals' seeding).\n  \n  The illustrate shows that the all top eight fastest swimmers have been placed in heat four. All the slowest swimmers are in the heat one.\n  Circle seeding. (Also used by 'Quarter' and 'Semi'- Finals').\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n          Circle seeding is selected.\n          In this example the seed depth will be set to two. This means the two fastest heats, three and four, will be circle seed.\n          The heats one and two will use the default seed method.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  Note: SwimClubMeet first builds a stack of swimmers, fastest to slowest. Calculates the number of heats and count of swimmers needed. Then it builds heats, fastest to slowest. Hence circle seeding is top down.\n  \n  It can be seen that there is now a 'spread' of fastest swimmers in heats four and three. Your fastest swimmer is in heat four. the second fastest swimmer in heat three. They both are given lane four.\n  Perchance - entrant placement in heats two and one are identical to the previous default seeding.\n  Why circle seed?\n  When you have many entrants to an event (say four or five heats) you may want to circle seed to improve the racing experience for your top contenders.\n  It's recommended that you don't exceed a depth of three. The racing experience (a club level) for bottom ranked swimmers isn't improved if you go beyond three. \n  Other notes\n  When creating a 'FINAL' the default seeding is used. This a system default, SCM managed. Your seed settings in options are ignored. \n  When creating a 'SEMI' or 'QUARTER-FINAL' circle seeding is used.

For example the role, SCM_Guest can only read SwimClubMeet tables.\n  Examples of Server IP or Named Path.:\n  192.168.0.1:1433\n  The above example uses an IP address and port number\n  localHost\\SQLEXPRESS\n  In this example the 'localhost' is a hostname that refers to the local machine currently making the request. On many computers, localhost is an alias for the IP address 127.0.0.1. When a computer pings this IP address, it is communicating with itself. The 'SQLEXPRESS' after the backslash refers to the registered server name or instance of the SQL database server.\n  DESKTOP-KN145\\SQLEXPRESS\n  The above example uses a computer name and server instance name. A computer name is a unique identifier that is given to each computer. A computer name can be used to identify the computer on a domain or network.\n   \n\n","Path::contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Login.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Details.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Details.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Details.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"}],"Path::contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Details.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Details.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Details.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Details.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Details.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Details.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Details.htm::Title":"BMAC_Details","Path::contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Details.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/SCM_BuildMeAClub/BMAC_Intro/BMAC_Details.htm::InnerText":"\n  This special tool creates the SwimClubMeet database on SQLEXPRESS.\n  It ensures that you have SQLEXPRESS by asking you to login into the SQL server.\n  If successfull it'll display the button 'Build Me A Club'.\n  When you press this button it will first make some checks.\n  If you already have a SwimClubMeet database on you SQL server, it'll abort.\n  The application has a large number of SQL scripts that it will run on the SQL server.\n  SCM_BuildMeAClub uses the sqlcmd.exe commandline utility when processing these scripts.

Refresh.\n            An important button if you are using the support apps (Marshall, Nominate, TimeKeeper). As these external apps can change data within you Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS SwimClubMeet database, this refresh button re-syncs the core app.\n            For example: \n              If the Marshall disqualifies a swimmer, then after a re-fresh you'll see the heat display a check mark in the disqualified box.\n              If the Timekeeper enters a swimmers race time, then after a re-fresh, that time appears in the heat.\n            To keep all connections to the database in sync, It's good practise to formulate or agree apoun a 'race running procedure'. For example: After the timekeeper signals the marshal that all racetime sare 'in', then the Marshal signals that the heat has been 'raced'. Then the SCM adminiatrator to re-freshes the core application and 'Q&A' that all the race times are accounted for. Only then does the SCM administator closes the heat.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n\n"}
