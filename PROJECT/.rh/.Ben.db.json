And someone is sitting in a corner, entering racetimes, probably into a spread sheet.

Select all and then BACKSPACE to zero.\n  \n  RACETIME - exit edit mode.\n  Press ENTER, TAB, SHIFT-TAB. Or click outside the CELL.\n  SCRATCHED, DISQUALIFIED\n  Pressing the SPACE key or mouse CLICK will toggle the checkbox.\n  Entrant Name Column\n  Manual Lane Assignment.\n  To manually place a nominee in an empty lane or bump a nominee...\n  Select the Entrant's Name CELL of the lane you want to re-assign. A selection box appears around the CELL.\n  \n  Click the cell once more. Doing so has set the CELL to edit mode. Another way to enter edit mode is to use the keyboard short-cut f2. Yet another way is to use the enter key.\n  \n  Notice, you can't edit the swimmers name. The only active part is the ellipse button, which is located at the far end of the CELL.\n  Ellipse button. Method 1.\n  Left mouse click the ellipse button to open the Quick Pick Nominee dialogue.\n  For this event ...\n  \n  The swimmers shown in the list are all nominees that haven't been given a lane. \n  If the list is empty, then ever swimmer that nominated has a lane.\n  Clicking a column heading will sort by that column. Click again will invert the sort order.\n  If the list is very long, then use the search editbox to narrow it down. It used wildcards, so you only need to enter a part or snippet of a nominee's name. It reacts in real time to your key strokes. To see the full list again, clear the search editbox.\n  The TimeToBeat, age and gender give you useful information on whom to pick, when manually constructing a heat.\n  Double click on the chosen record to place the nominee into the lane. Else click the post button. As expected, the cancel button closes the dialogue without any changes being made.\n  If you are re-assigning swimmers. Then the swimmer who has been 'bumped' out of their lane is returned to the nominees list, awaiting a lane assignment.\n  The process works on blank lanes - you can fill a blank lane with a nominee. But to empty a lane of it's entrant, use the empty lane button.\n  Once the assignment is done and the dialogue closes, to exit 'edit mode', either tab or click outside the CELL. Exiting edit-mode finalizes the change.\n  Ellipse button. Method 2.\n  Cntrl-left mouse click the cell's Ellipse button to open the Quick Pick Member dialogue.\n  The dialogue is very simular. Note the title on the caption bar is different, and list is significantly larger.\n  All active club members who swim appear in this list. With the exception of swimmers who have been given a lane in the event. \n  Functionality is identical to the previous dialogue.\n  The magic done here is this... if you assign a member to a lane then you have also nominated that member for the event. 'Two birds with one stone'. You created both a nominee and an entrant.\n  Moving Entrants \n  To move entrants to a different lane, select the lane with the entrant you wish to move, click the arrow up or arrow down buttons. This works for empty lanes too.\n  To move an entrant into the previous or next heat, continue pressing the arrow up or arrow down buttons.\n  The keyboard short-cuts are ctrl-up and ctrl-down.\n  Us the Switch Lanes button as an alternative method to swap an entrant between lanes and events. \n  More entrant table columns.\n  Lane#\n  A read-only CELL. The pool's lane number. The number of lanes that appears in the table is determined by \n  Tools ... Options ... Club ... Number of lanes  \n  RaceTime\n  It's in this CELL that you enter a swimmer's time for racing the event.\n  Select the CELL by Tab or mouse click, a selection box appears arround the CELL.\n  \n  Press enter or Click the cell once more. Doing so has set the CELL to edit mode. Yet another way to enter edit mode is to use the keyboard short-cut f2.\n  This CELL uses a template to assist you in entering time. The  ':', '.' characters cannot be type over. Use the left and right arrow keys to navigate. Double click to select all.\n  The quickest method to entering racetimes is to select all, then start typing. If you want to enter 31 seconds and 41/100ths, do this, type 003141. There is no need to type the ':', '.' characters.\n  Entering an invalid time, for example 01:62.20, will be ignored. You can't have 62 seconds! The racetime will revert when you exit edit-mode - ignoring your erronous entry. Note: you aren't prompted with an error message. Double check your racetimes.\n  To finalize your changes, exit edit-mode by pressing tab or enter or arrow up or arrow down or click outside the CELL.\n  To clear a racetime, select all and press the backspace key. The racetime will be set to zero. When you exit edit-mode the CELL will be painted blank.\n  The TimeKeepers application can set a swimmer's RaceTime remotely.\n  Most human timekeepers aren't the best at recording 1000ths. The reason SwimClubMeet accepts this precision is to prepare itself for electronic touch-pads. A future addition.\n  TODO: RaceTime additional keyboard short-cuts : CTRL-A select all. CTRL-C copy to clipboard. CTRL-P paste from clipboard. CTRL-X cut (clear) racetime. Warning message or visual indicator for illegal racetimes.\n  TimeToBeat\n  This is a read only calculated field. SCM  has determined that the entrant will most likely swim the event in this time (based on historical data).\n  Auto-Create Heats usesTimeToBeat to build a list of swimmers, ordered fastest to lowest.  Swimmers without a TTB will be placed in the slowest heat. If you would like to know more about how TTB works, then follow this link.\n  PersonalBest \n  This is a read only calculated field. The Personal Best (PB) is an entrants best racetime achieved for the event - up to but excluding the current session.\n  D\n  If checked this indicates the entrant has been disqualified by the race marshall.

Seed method.\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Overview of options ...\n  TTB is used to build a list of entrants, ordered by fastest to slowest.  These calculated racetimes will determine which heat and lane a swimmer is given.\n  1. The entrant's Time-To-Beat \n  You are given three options to calculate the time-to-beat for each entrant. These options require that the entrant have previously raced the event. ie. there is historical data. The default is 'Use the average of the 3 fastest race times'. Only data that pre-dates the current selected session is used.\n  2. Estimate a Time-To-Beat \n  This section of the dialogue can create a time-to-beat for an entrants with no historical race data.  By default, this is enabled. There is no good reason to disable this feature, other than to improve the DB Server performance.\n  The algorithm does this.\n  A. List all the swimmers of the same age and gender who have swum the event. Use only the bottom 50% and get the average time. If this fails (no data, or there is less than 4 swimmers) go to step B.\n  B. List all the swimmers of the same age - ignore gender ... rinse and repeat. If this fails go to step C.\n  C. List all the swimmers in an age bracket (currently set at : plus/minus 1 year) ... rinse and repeat. If this fails, step D.\n  D. Give this swimmer a race time of NULL. This swimmer will be placed in the slowest heat.\n  If you have a lot of data - many years of club nights - then it's time to tweak the percentage. I suggest dropping it over time to 30 percent. Typically, swimmers in untrialled events under-preform. Email me if I'm wrong.  \n  3. Special Options.\n  Seperate gender. For each gender, a list of entrants will be made, ordered fastest to slowest. Each list will be given seperate heats. eg. Split male and female into seperate heats. Said differently, boys don't race the girls.\n  Exclude gutter lanes. If checked, swimmers will not be placed in the outside lanes. eg. If you have an 8 lane pool - well now you have only 6. Helpful if you have ladders that protude in the side lanes.\n  4. Group by..\n  Another way to group entrants. Fine tune the stacking of entrant numbers across heats.\n  \n    Don't group ... disables group by.\n    Entrant's age ... swimmers with the same age are placed in the same heat. May produce a large amount of heats.\n    Membership type ... swimmers of the same membership type are placed in the same heat.\n  \n  5. Seed Method\n  A full description of seeding (with diagrams) is given here.\n  But in a 'nut-shell'.\n  SwimClubMeet (default). After filters and grouping, the resultant entrants are placed in a list fastest to slowest.  Fastest swimmers swim the last heat. Slowest are in the first heat.\n  For a eight lane pool - Swimmers are scattered as per Olymic Standards 4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 1, 8. Fastest swimmer swims lane 4. Slowest swimmer in lane 8.\n  Circle Seeding. Gets a little more complicated. Say you have 8 lanes and 4 heats. Your seed depth is 2.\n  After filters and grouping, the resultant entrants are placed in a list fastest to slowest. Fastest heat is heat 4. Slowest is heat 1.\n  Only heats 3 and 4 are circle seeded. Heats 1 and 2 use the default seeding.\n  The fastest swimmer goes into heat 4 lane 4. The 2nd Fastest swimmer is placed in heat 3 lane 4. The 3rd fastest is place in heat 4 lane 5. The fourth fastest is placed in heat 4 lane 5. And so on .... \n  Why use circle seeding? By mixing up the ranked swimmers, it'll change the racing dynamics and 'freshen-up' the competition. Just another reason why you want to go to 'Club Night'.\n  Circle seeding is best used on events with a large number of entrants. \n  Special Note.\n  Any changes made in this dialogue become the new default settings used by SCM. Said differently - settings are mirrored in the Tool Options dialogue.\n  Learn more  ...\n  TTB is also mirrored in Options.  \n  Auto-Build is also mirrored in Options. \n  Follow the link to a summary of

The order for an eight lane pool goes something like this .... 4,5,3,6,2,7,1,8. The algorithm used in SCM will correctly scatter for any sized pool. Even pools with an odd number of lanes.\n  Consider this ...\n  \n  Each square represents a swimmer. Fastest swimmer is green, intermediate yellow, slowest red. A total of 32 swimmers will require four heats in an eight lane pool.\n  Default seeding. (This algorithm is also used by 'Finals' seeding).\n  \n  The illustrate shows that the all top eight fastest swimmers have been placed in heat four. All the slowest swimmers are in the heat one.\n  Circle seeding. (Also used by 'Quarter' and 'Semi'- Finals').\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n          Circle seeding is selected.\n          In this example the seed depth will be set to two. This means the two fastest heats, three and four, will be circle seed.\n          The heats one and two will use the default seed method.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  Note: SwimClubMeet first builds a stack of swimmers, fastest to slowest. Calculates the number of heats and count of swimmers needed. Then it builds heats, fastest to slowest. Hence circle seeding is top down.\n  \n  It can be seen that there is now a 'spread' of fastest swimmers in heats four and three. Your fastest swimmer is in heat four. the second fastest swimmer in heat three. They both are given lane four.\n  Perchance - entrant placement in heats two and one are identical to the previous default seeding.\n  Why circle seed?\n  When you have many entrants to an event (say four or five heats) you may want to circle seed to improve the racing experience for your top contenders.\n  It's recommended that you don't exceed a depth of three. The racing experience (a club level) for bottom ranked swimmers isn't improved if you go beyond three. \n  Other notes\n  When creating a 'FINAL' the default seeding is used. This a system default, SCM managed. Your seed settings in options are ignored. \n  When creating a 'SEMI' or 'QUARTER-FINAL' circle seeding is used. (... again SCM managed)\n\n","Path::contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconSCM.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconSCM.png"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconBMAC.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconBMAC.png"},{"origLink":"#","attr":"href","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm"},{"origLink":"#","attr":"href","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconUpdate.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconUpdate.png"},{"origLink":"#","attr":"href","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconNominate.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconNominate.png"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconMarshall.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconMarshall.png"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconTimeKeeper.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconTimeKeeper.png"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconLeaderBoard.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconLeaderBoard.png"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconHelp.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconHelp.png"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconMember.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconMember.png"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconChart.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconChart.png"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconReport.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconReport.png"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconMissing.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconMissing.png"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/SCM_IconMissing.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SCM_IconMissing.png"},{"origLink":"#","attr":"href","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm"},{"origLink":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server","attr":"href","topic":"contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm","nodeName":"a","external":true,"relPath":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server"}],"Path::contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm::Glossary":["Default_MSSQL_EXPRESS","Default_BMAC","Default_SCM_","Default_SCM_"],"Path::contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/System_Info/Application_List.htm::Title":"Application

Data outside of these bounds is ignored.\n  TimeToBeat is calculated actively, in real time. By default it uses the average of the 3 fastest times the member has swum. Alternatively it can use the last known race time or the member's personal best .\n  If a member doesn't have any RaceTime data, then a time is calculated based on the mean average of the bottom 50% (default), with consideration to age and gender. If there is still insufficient data it'll ignore gender. It there is still not enough data (default:  at least 4 records) then it will re-calculate, doing an age spread (default: plus or minus 1 year).\n  If after all this process time, a suitable racetime can't be found, then the TimeToBeat is left empty.

In the moment that the Auto-Build button is pressed, all TTBs are calculated for all nominees for the given event, in real time. The data used is all the racetimes of all members that pre-dates the selected session. The TTB data is used to build a list of entrants, fastest to slowest. Those without a TTB will end at the bottom of this list and placed into the slowest heat. A new member, without a race history, may be incorrectly place for the first instance but once a race has been swum and their racetime data is entered, that member will always be placed correctly.\n   \n  If you want to 'kick-start' your TimeToBet algorithm (you have just installed the application and you have no data) then you could add a session that is dated prior to the new swimming season. Populate that session with events, filled with the personal best times for all of your members.

We are looking for 'Protocols for SQLEXPRESS'\n  \n  Ensure  'TCP/IP' is enable.\n  Computer Management - Set TCP/IP configuration.\n  Double click 'TCP/IP' (found under the column 'Protocol Name') to open the Properties panel.\n  \n  Make sure Listen All is set to Yes.\n  Next - select the IP Addresses tab.\n  \n  We are looking for the 'IPALL'.\n  Blank out the TCP Dynamic Ports by removing it's '0'\n  Put the default SQLEXPRESS server port number '1433' into TCP Port\n  Press OK\n  Computer Management - Restart the SQLEXPRESS server.\n  While in the 'Computer Management', lets restart the SQLEXPRESS server.  \n  Locate 'SQL Server Services' - select it.\n  \n  Next, in right hand panel, select SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS) \n  \n  Right mouse and select 'Restart' from the pop-down menu.\n  Restarting will ensure all of our changes are applied.\n  Ok - if you have made this far then you now have the server listening on port 1433.\n  Next step is to get the SQLEXPRESS database to accept remote logins. Close up any apps and lets move on.\n  Enable TCP logins for the SwimClubMeet database.\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Start the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Connect to your SQLEXPRESS ....\n          Server name: localhost\\SQLEXPRESS  \n          The dot variation, .\\SQLEXPRESS,  is another alternative.\n          Or a fully qualified server name would be the name of your computer name with an attached instance name. As shown in the example.\n           Authentication :\n          Here you can use 'Windows Authentication'. \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Now that you have successfully logged in, the next step is to select the server name (top line).  The right mouse and select Properties from the popup menu\n  \n  With the Server Properties dialogue open, select the 'Security' tab. Then select the radiobutton 'SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode'. Doing this will enable remote login using the server's user accounts.\n  \n  Press OK. This change won't come into effect until we restart the server.\n  Restart the SQLEXPRESS server.\n  Select the server name (top line). Right mouse, but this time select 'Restart' from the popup menu.\n  \n  With that done, the next is to setup the remote login.\n  Setup a 'scmAdmin' SwimClubMeet remote database login.\n  When the SwimClubMeet application 'BuildMeAClub' was ran it created some useful 'Roles', SwimClubMeet Users and a single Login name.\n  Open up the Security branch. You'll see the remote login name scmAdmin. (There are multiply security branches, make sure you have selected the 'root' branch' as shown below.)\n  \n  Currently it's offline and has a random password. Double click scmAdmin.\n  \n  In the generals tab - you'll note, I've disabled 'Enforce password policy'. That way I can enter a 'short' password.\n  Go do the same - enter a  password for your scmAdmin user and then confirm the password by typing it again in the 'Confirm password' editbox.\n  Next we'll check mappings. Select the 'User Mappings' tab. Then select SwimClubMeet and confirm the following ...\n   \n  Make sure the following are checked ...\n  \n    db_datareader\n    db_datawriter\n    public (optional)\n    SCM_Administrator\n  \n  The last one, 'SCM_Administrator' allows the user scmAdmin to do select actions or tasks to the SwimClubMeet tables. 'SCM_Administrator' is a SQLSERVER 'role' definition. Some SCM system tables are in-accessable to scmAdmin. However when running any of the SwimClubMeet application, logged in as scmAdmin, all application functionality is operable. (Later... If you explore in the SwimClubMeet security sub-branch, you'll notice other SCM 'roles'.)\n  One last job. Select the Status tab. Select the radio button 'Enabled' for the 'Login' option.\n  \n  Press OK\n  And that should do it. It shouldn't be necessary to do another restart of the database changes. (?)\n  Close down MSSMS. \n  Set the firewall to allows communications on the port. (UDP, TCP)\n  If you have a virus protection application running - then this will block port 1433, unless enabled.\n  Here are the steps to enable these port when using Windows Defender Firewall.\n  (You maybe using a different firewall/security application. Instructions to setup UDP/TCP will differ.)\n  Type 'Fire' in the Windows search box. Select the 'Windows Defender Firewall' app.\n  Once open, select 'Advance Settings'.\n  \n  Here it is open and I've selected Inbound Rules. You can see I've already made my SQLEXPRESS 1433 TCP inbound rule for the SQLEXPRESS 1433 static port.\n  \n  To create an inbound rule, select Action >> New Rule ...\n  \n  When the dialogue has open, select Port, then click Next\n  \n  We need to do both TCP and UDP. Lets start with UDP. Select the UDP radiobutton. Select 'Specific local ports' and then enter 1433 in the editbox.\n  \n  Click Next\n  \n  Select 'Allow the connection'. Click Next\n  \n  Select all checkboxes (enable across all connections).  Click Next\n  \n  Give it a title, maybe a description then click Finish.\n  RINSE AND REPEAT. Repeat the same procedure for TCP on port 1433.\n  Click Finish\n  Close the defender firewall application. The SQLEXPRESS 1433 port is now open across all connections.\n  NOW WE MUST CHECK\n  Does the login work locally? Lets test that out.\n  Close all apps. (DO A REBOOT, ENSURE EVERTHING IS INITIALISED)\n  Run SwimClubMeet and try this login...\n  \n  Did it work? Can you edit, delete, move stuff about? If it's worked - then your scmAdmin user is up and running.\n  Now we'll attempt to use the Loop-Back feature to test an IP connection. Disconnect from Wi-Fi. Remove ethernet cable, etc. (Restart PC?) Then try this... \n  \n  Note the comma after the IP address, then the static port number 1433. Did it work? This isn't a solid test for IP connectivity - but it's a good indicator all is well. \n  LIFT OFF\n  Well you are ready for the real world now. Get connected via local Wi-Fi, physical router or the internet! \n  AFTER CONNECTION  - Check your server IP address in Computer Management - Protocols for SQLEXPRESS (typically IP4 or IP6) . \n  You can also use ipconfig at the command line tool to find your current computer's ip address - the SQLEXPRESS server should be using these addresses. (?)\n  On the computer connecting ...\n  \n    Prepare it's firewall to allow communications on port 1433 .\n    When logging in, use the IP address and port of the (remote) SQLEXPRESS server.\n    Login with username scmAdmin and password.\n  \n  Router Configuration..\n  Important notes: \n  Wi-Fi routers will need 'Port Forwarding' enabled for the 1433 port. (both TCP UDP) \n  Your router acts as DNS and assigns IP adresses to each connection. Most routers have a setting to 'lease' a fixed IP address to the same computer on connection. The 'lease time' can be hours or 'forever'. Consider setting the lease time for computer with the MS SQL server to 'forever'. That way the login IP address will always be same. \n  As each router is different, sorry no help session, instead refer to your router's manual..\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n","Path::contents/Tools/Score.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"Option_Score.htm#Score_Setup","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Tools/Option_Score.htm"},{"origLink":"Option_Score.htm#Score_Points","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Tools/Option_Score.htm"},{"origLink":"Option_Score.htm#Score_Division","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Tools/Option_Score.htm"},{"origLink":"Option_Score.htm#Score_LeaderBoard","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Tools/Option_Score.htm"},{"origLink":"Option_Score.htm#Score_Report","attr":"href","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/Tools/Option_Score.htm"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/Score_SetUp.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Score_SetUp.jpg"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/Score_Place.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Score_Place.jpg"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/Score_Divisions_A.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Score_Divisions_A.jpg"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/Score_LeaderBoard.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Score_LeaderBoard.jpg"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/Score_Report.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Score_Report.jpg"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/Score_Report_B.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Score_Report_B.jpg"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/Score_Report_C.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Score_Report_C.jpg"},{"origLink":"../assets/images/Score_Report_D.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/Tools/Score.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Score_Report_D.jpg"}],"Path::contents/Tools/Score.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/Tools/Score.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/Tools/Score.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/Tools/Score.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/Tools/Score.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/Tools/Score.htm::Bookmarks":[{"id":"Score_Setup","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Score_Points","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Score_Division","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Score_LeaderBoard","tagName":"a","innerText":""},{"id":"Score_Report","tagName":"a","innerText":""}],"Path::contents/Tools/Score.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/Tools/Score.htm::Title":"Score","Path::contents/Tools/Score.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/Tools/Score.htm::InnerText":"\n  Tools Score\n  Setup\n  Points\n  Divisions\n  Leader Board\n  Reports\n   \n  Setup\n  Calculate the entrant's age as of ...\n  ... the start of the swimming season. \n  The swimming season date is set in tools .. options.\n  ... the current session\n  Calculate the leader board score as of the ...\n  Future versions will allow for an accumlative score across multi-sessions.

SCM will auto-matically determine which table to used based on what is entered here. If your swimming pool doesn't conform to these two lengths, any pool longer than 33.3 yards (30.4m) is considered a long course pool. This means most olympic diving pools will be short course pools.\n  Season Starts\n  In Australia the summer season starts in October.The date given here is used in auditing and calculating members age.
