 SQLEXPRESS comes with the default Windows Authentication mode when you first install it locally. With the Windows authentication mode, SQLEXPRESS can validate a user by their Windows username and password. This means the password is not required once the user is logged into the Windows system. \n  The alternative method, the SQLEXPRESS authentication mode enables a user login (which is different from a Windows login). To use SQLEXPRES authentication mode you must give a user name and password. The SwimClubMeet database has a pre-installed user and schema, scmAdmin. Some additional security setup at the root level is required before scmAdmin can be used. \n  Also pre-installed are the roles, SCM_Administrator, SCM_Marshal and SCM_Guest. These roles have special permission mappings on all the SwimClubMeet tables. For example the role, SCM_Guest can only read SwimClubMeet tables.\n  Examples of Server IP or Named Path.:\n  192.168.0.1:1433\n  The above example uses an IP address and port number\n  localHost\\SQLEXPRESS\n  In this example the 'localhost' is a hostname that refers to the local machine currently making the request. On many computers, localhost is an alias for the IP address 127.0.0.1. When a computer pings this IP address, it is communicating with itself.

TimeToBeat (TTB) - Primary option\n    \n      The time-to-beat determine which heat and lanes the entrant will be placed\n      into. The TTB is calculated on demand.\n    \n    You have a pick of three algorithms.\n    \n      \n        👉 Use the last known race-time. SCM will excluding the current session\n        when searching. If nothing is found. SCM uses the secondary option, if\n        enabled.\n      \n      \n        👉 Use the average of the 3 fastest race-times. The search excludes the\n        current session and sessions that post dates the current. An average\n        race-time is calculated. Finding only one record is acceptable. If none\n        are found, SCM moves to the secondary option, if enabled\n      \n      \n        👉 Use participants personal best (PB). If nothing is found, SCM uses the\n        secondary option, if enabled. Else the entrant is placed in the slowest heat.\n      \n      \n        Unless specified, TTB is calculated from data that pre-dates\n        the current selected session. \n      \n    \n\n    \n    2. Members without race-times - Secondary option.\n    \n      For entrants new to the event type, this algorithm will use brute force to\n      find a race-time and calculate a TTB. The process goes like this...\n    \n    \n      If a member doesn't have any race time data, then a time is calculated\n      based on the mean average of the bottom 50% (default), with consideration\n      to age and gender.\n    \n    \n      If there's still insufficient data, SCM will ignore gender and try once\n      more.\n    \n    \n      If there is still not enough data (at least 4 records) then it will\n      re-calculate, doing an age spread (plus or minus 1 year). There are\n      currently no options for you to adjust minimum records and the spread\n      values.\n    \n\n    \n      If after all this, a suitable race time can't be found, then the\n      TimeToBeat is left empty. This effectively places the swimmer in the\n      slowest heats.\n    \n\n    \n      For a more comprehensive discussion on the workings of TTB follow this...\n      link.\n    \n\n    \n    3. Gender and lane count\n    \n      If Separate gender is checked then there will\n      be separate heats for each gender. ie. Boys will not race against girls.\n      The order of the heats is slowest to fastest, with the girl swimming prior\n      to the boys.\n    \n    \n      if Exclude outside lanes is checked then\n      gutter lanes will not be used in events. If you have an eight lane pool,\n      lane 1 and 8 will not be filled with swimmers. Helpful if your club is\n      small and you want to run more heats, or if ladders obstruct the gutter\n      lanes. It should be pointed out that all your pools lanes still appear in\n      the lane grid, gutter exclusion on or off.\n    \n\n    \n    4. Group by ...\n    Currently only two group types are defined.\n    \n      \n        👉 Entrant's age. Swimmers are placed into heats based on their age\n        (calculated using the members DOB). Depending on club size, this may\n        result in many heats with few participants in each heat.\n      \n      \n        👉 Entrant's membership type. The membership table is inspected and the\n        members are organized into heats based on type. This is one way to\n        collectively gather swimmers into broad categories based on age. It's\n        dependant on keeping the member's membership type up-to-date. An audit\n        at the start of the each swimming season would be needed. Useful option\n        for club championships.\n      \n      \n        Need a little bit more information on the membership types? Follow this\n        link.\n      \n    \n    Selecting Don't group disables grouping.\n\n    \n    5. Seed Method ...\n    \n      A topic that has it's own page. To learn what seeding is and how it works,\n      follow this link.\n    \n\n    Other miscellaneous notes ...\n    \n      Changes made in this dialogue are remembered next time you use the tool.\n      Individual events don't store snap-shots of these settings when auto-build\n      is enacted. There is only one set of parameters and it's up to you to\n      manage its state.\n    \n

SQL Server Express comes with the default Windows\n      Authentication mode when you first install it locally.

They also can view the leader-board.\n    \n\n    \n      On install, a scmAdmin user and profile is created. It is a signed the\n      SCM_Administrator role.

But if you are running\n      identical events, then this column is required. For example, you have\n      2x50M Freestyle events. One for boys under 14 years and one for girls\n      under 14 years. You'll need to describe these events, else caous.\n    \n\n    \n      SCM can be told to place an auto description, each time you create a new\n      event. The text used can be found in the\n      Tools ➡ Options ➡ System ➡ Event_Grid. You can\n      modify this text.\n    \n\n    \n      \n        Note: on future versions of SCM, you'll be able to use meta-data to\n        customize the descriptions based on the event type. (wit.\n        auto-descriptions will be a little more useful.)\n      \n    \n\n    \n      When SCM creates finals, semi-finals and quarter-finals, it will write an\n      auto-description. SCM adds these descriptions so the special events are\n      delineated from the seed event.\n    \n\n    \n    Grid column - Distance.\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            SCM's default distances are 25m, 50m, 100m, 200m, 400m, 1000m.\n            Distances are not arbitrary, they can be changed or added too in the\n            SCM MSSQL database using SSMS.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    How to edit distance.\n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          Using mouse.

The algorithm used in SCM will correctly scatter for any\n      sized pool. Even pools with an odd number of lanes.\n    \n    Consider this ...\n    \n    \n      Each square represents a swimmer. Fastest swimmer is green, intermediate\n      yellow, slowest red. A total of 32 swimmers will require four heats in an\n      eight lane pool.\n    \n    Default seeding. (This algorithm is also used by 'Finals' seeding).\n    \n    \n      The illustrate shows that the all top eight fastest swimmers have been\n      placed in heat four. All the slowest swimmers are in the heat one.\n    \n    \n      Circle seeding. (Also used by 'Quarter' and 'Semi'- Finals').\n    \n\n    Circle seeding is selected.\n    \n      In this example the seed depth will be set to two. This means the two\n      fastest heats, three and four, will be circle seed.\n    \n    The heats one and two will use the default seed method.\n    \n      Note: SwimClubMeet first builds a stack of swimmers, fastest to slowest.\n      Calculates the number of heats and count of swimmers needed. Then it\n      builds heats, fastest to slowest. Hence circle seeding is top down.\n    \n    \n    \n      It very subtle but you can see that there is now a 'spread' of fastest swimmers in heats\n      3 and 4. Your fastest swimmer is in heat 4, lane 4. the second fastest\n      swimmer in heat 3, lane 4. Think of it as heat 3 and 4 being equal.\n    \n    For competative swimming, circle seeding uses a depth equal to the number of heats. \n\n    Why circle seed at club night?\n    \n      When you have many entrants to an event (say four or five heats) you may\n      want to circle seed to improve the racing experience for your top\n      contenders.\n    \n    \n      It's recommended that you don't exceed a depth of three. The racing\n      experience (at club level) for bottom ranked swimmers isn't improved if you\n      go beyond three.\n    \n    Other notes\n    \n      When creating a 'FINAL' the default seeding is used. This a system\n      default, SCM managed. Your seed settings in options are ignored.\n    \n    \n      When creating a 'SEMI' or 'QUARTER-FINAL' circle seeding is used. (...\n      again SCM managed).

The two above methods modify the same\n      set. The methods are congruent.\n    \n\n    How it works.\n    \n      SwimMeetClub keeps a log of all the race times swum by every member in\n      your club. It could easily store hundreds of years of racing data.\n    \n\n    \n      It's this racing data that SwimClubMeet uses to calculate the TimeToBeat.\n      The more data there is, the better the results.\n    \n\n    \n      TimeToBeat is always calculated based on the events swum up to but not\n      including the current selected session. Future data, sessions which\n      post-date the current select session, are excluded. If you select a\n      session in the middle of SCM's stack of sessions, then all the sessions\n      above it are ignored.\n    \n    \n      There is one exception to the rules given above. When making Finals,\n      Semi-Finals and Quarter-Finals the racetimes of the current selected\n      session is considered. (Think about it, it makes sense 😉.)\n    \n\n    \n      TimeToBeat is calculated actively, in real time. By default it uses the\n      average of the 3 fastest times the member has swum. Alternatively it can\n      use the last known race time or the member's personal best. You get to\n      chose which one of these in the options dialogue.\n    \n\n    \n      If a member doesn't have any race time data, then a time is calculated\n      based on the mean average of the bottom 50% (default), with consideration\n      to age and gender. You can turn this feature off in the option dialogue.\n      Why you would do this - I don't know - perhaps you want to manually arrange\n      swimmers new to the event? You might lower the percentage rate as you gain\n      more race data. It's very dependant on the club demographics as to what is\n      the perfect percentage.\n    \n\n    \n      If there's still insufficient data, SCM will ignore gender and try once\n      more.\n    \n    \n      If there is still not enough data (at least 4 records) then it will\n      re-calculate, doing an age spread (plus or minus 1 year). There are\n      currently no options for you to adjust minimum records and the spread\n      values.\n    \n\n    \n      If after all this, a suitable race time can't be found, then the\n      TimeToBeat is left empty. This effectively places the swimmer in the\n      slowest heats.\n    \n\n    Auto-Build button.\n    This is what happens when you press the Auto-Build Heats button.\n\n    \n      TimeToBeat is used to select the heat and lane that a member will be\n      given. In the moment that the Auto-Build button is pressed, all TTBs are\n      calculated for all nominees for the given event, in real time. The data\n      used is all the race times of all members that pre-dates the selected\n      session. The TTB data is used to build a list of entrants, fastest to\n      slowest. Those without a TTB will end at the bottom of this list and\n      placed into the slowest heat. A new member, without a race history, may be\n      incorrectly place for the first instance but once a race has been swum and\n      their race time data is entered, that member will always be placed\n      correctly.\n    \n\n    I have no race data ...\n\n    \n      If you want to know how to kick-start your TimeToBet algorithm then\n      follow this ...\n      link\n    \n  \n\n","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/css/scm.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/scm.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/MenuBar/mb_AboutDlg.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/MenuBar/mb_AboutDlg.png"}],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm::Title":"Version Info","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"version,fileversion,about","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm::InnerText":"\n    SwimClubMeet version information.\n    \n    \n      Use the About dialogue to see what SCM version you are\n      currently running.

Then assign permissions so\n              that login can work in the SwimClubMeet database\n            \n            \n              SCM_BuildMeAClub has created some useful Roles and Schemas within\n              the SwimClubMeet database. These can be used to setup your remote\n              logins.\n            \n            \n              \n                        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n    Ensure the following are checked for schema SCM_Administrator\n    \n      db_datareader\n      db_datawriter\n    \n\n    Ensure the new login is enabled.\n    Close down MSSMS.\n\n    \n    \n      5. Set the firewall to allows communications on the port. (UDP, TCP)\n    \n    \n      If you are running a virus protection application, then SQLEXPRESS is\n      fire-walled. It cannot send data across the assigned port. You must\n      configure your virus protection application to port forward the assigned\n      port. In both directions, and for both protocols, TCP and UDP.\n    \n    \n      As every virus protection package is different, it's not possible to do a\n      step-by-step of the configuration procedure. For testing, you might\n      consider disabling your firewall. Then re-enable once the router, remote\n      PCs and database server are all talking.\n    \n\n    \n    6. Test the connection.\n    Disable your firewall.\n    Does the login work locally? Lets test that out.\n    Close all apps. DO A REBOOT, ENSURE EVERYTHING IS INITIALIZED.\n    Run SwimClubMeet and try this login...\n    localhost\\SQLEXPRESS login:scmAdmin password:####\n    \n      Did it work? Can you edit, delete, move stuff about? If it's worked - then\n      your scmAdmin user is up and running.\n    \n    \n      Now we'll attempt to use the Loop-Back feature to test an IP connection.\n      Disconnect from Wi-Fi. Remove ethernet cable, etc. (Restart PC?) Then try\n      this...\n    \n    IP address of db server - 127.0.0.1,1433 login:scmAdmin password:####\n    \n      Note the comma after the IP address, then the static port number 1433. Did\n      it work? This isn't a solid test for IP connectivity - but it's a good\n      indicator all is well.\n    \n\n    Router Configuration..\n    Important notes: \n    \n      Wi-Fi routers will need 'Port Forwarding' enabled for the assigned port,\n      in both direction, for protocols TCP and UDP.\n    \n    \n      Your router acts as DNS and assigns IP addresses to each connection. Most\n      routers have a setting to 'lease' a fixed IP address to the same computer\n      on connection. The 'lease time' can be hours or 'forever'. Consider\n      setting the lease time for computer with the MS SQL server to 'forever'.\n      That way the login IP address will always be same.\n    \n    \n      As each router is different, sorry no help session, instead refer to your\n      router's manual..\n    \n  \n\n","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/css/scm.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/scm.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/Tools_House/House_Details.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Tools_House/House_Details.jpg"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/Tools_House/House_Report.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Tools_House/House_Report.jpg"}],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm::Title":"Tools House","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_House.htm::InnerText":"\n    Tools - House\n    \n      Create, delete houses.

The algorithm needs race-times\n      to create the TimeToBeat values needed to\n      match-up swimmers.\n    \n    \n      If you want to 'kick-start' your race-times then follow these steps prior\n      to the start of club night ...\n    \n\n    \n      👉 Add a new session that pre-dates the new swimming season.\n      👉 Populate that session with every type of imaginable event.\n      👉 Create some empty heats for those events by using the Create a New Heat button.\n      👉 Then fill those empty lanes with your members and enter their Personal Bests into the RaceTime cell.\n    \n    \n      Now when you run the very first SCM club night ... and you hit that\n      auto-build button, entrants are correctly matched.\n    \n\n    A new member joins - mid season.\n    \n      The special session created above is also useful in introducing a new\n      members into your club. Just add the new swimmer to your members list and\n      then find the pre-dated session and add the new member to events - where a\n      Personal Best is known.\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        Tip: To speed up the assignment of a member to a lane in a heat,\n        CNTRL-LMOUSE click the\n        Ellipse button.\n      \n      \n        Doing this circumnavigates the need to nominate the member, prior to\n        lane assignment.\n      \n      \n        Here's a link to the full description on how to use the above method ... link\n      \n    \n  \n\n","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/css/scm.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/scm.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/Tools_QualifyTimes/QualifyTimeDlg.JPG","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Tools_QualifyTimes/QualifyTimeDlg.JPG"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/Tools_QualifyTimes/QualifyTime_SnipEventList.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Tools_QualifyTimes/QualifyTime_SnipEventList.jpg"}],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm::Title":"Qualify Times","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm::Description":"Qualification times needed before entering a swimming event","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Tools/Tool_QualifyTimes.htm::InnerText":"\n    Tools - Qualify Times\n\n    \n      \n        A list of swimming times needed to qualify for an event.\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    What are qualification times?\n    \n      Qualification Times (QT) are the minimum swimming times allowed for a\n      given distance and stroke.\n    \n    \n      A swimmer must be able to complete the event within the QT, else the\n      swimmer is ineligible to swim that event.\n    \n    QT are age and gender specific.\n    \n      SCM uses separate QT tables for short and long course.

(be it the heat or the event).\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      The setup might appear complex a first. Clubs don't all score championship\n      in the same way. The above schema give you the flexibility to chose a\n      method that is best suited to your club.\n    \n\n    \n    Points\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            (DEVELOPER: This layout is horrible - in future releases expect\n            changes.)\n            \n              The first 32 places can be given a score. The logic behind this\n              madness goes a bit like this..\n            \n            \n              If the settings are\n              EVENT - ABSOLUTE or\n              EVENT - RELATIVE\n            \n            \n              In an event that has 4 heats with 8 swimmers, with this crazy\n              number of editboxes, it's possible to give everyone points. Most\n              school carnivals like to give all participants a point or two. It\n              makes the leaderboard light-up.\n            \n            \n              If the settings are\n              HEAT - ABSOLUTE or\n              HEAT - RELATIVE\n            \n            \n              You only need values for the first eight places (assuming your\n              pool has eight lanes.)\n            \n            \n              If you want more than 32 places to assign points, then pop into\n              the database and append additional records. (WARNING: Experience\n              needed.)\n            \n            \n              Tenths of a point are allowed. Using tenths can make for better\n              competition.\n            \n            Leave the field empty (00.0) for a place to be unscored.\n            \n              The last thing to mention is Unplaced points ... here we can\n              assign a value to the swimmers who came 33rd or greater. (I don't\n              believe I typed that.) This option is disabled. Currently these\n              swimmers are scored zero. In future version of SCM you will be\n              able to edit it and you will also be given an option to set the\n              cut-off point for swimmer placement.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    Divisions\n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            A division is an age range for a given gender. Ages are inclusive.\n            The\n            Age From value must be less or equal\n            to the Age To value.\n            Divisions are used when the score setup is RELATIVE.\n            You may have division that form INTERSECTIONS and INCLUSIONS.\n            An example\n            \n              A .. Girl's 8 years (8-8)\n              B .. Girl's 9 years (9-9)\n              C ... Girl's 8-12 years (8-12)\n            \n            \n              Both A and B are a subsets of C. (Division C holds the 'grand\n              finalists' for the under 12 girl's.)\n            \n            \n              Members in this example will be scored twice. this will\n              be delineated in reports, as each member's scores will be\n              described within the division that derived the score.\n            \n            The power of divisions are - you can mix everybody into an event, without consideration to age or gender, and out spits all the correct placing and scoring.

If nothing is found. SCM uses the secondary option, if\n        enabled.\n      \n      \n        👉 Use the average of the 3 fastest race-times. The search excludes the\n        current session and sessions that post dates the current. An average\n        race-time is calculated. Finding only one record is acceptable. If none\n        are found, SCM moves to the secondary option, if enabled\n      \n      \n        👉 Use particpants personal best (PB).

The process goes like this...\n    \n    \n      If a member doesn't have any race time data, then a time is calculated\n      based on the mean average of the bottom 50% (default), with consideration\n      to age and gender.\n    \n    \n      If there's still insufficient data, SCM will ignore gender and try once\n      more.\n    \n    \n      If there is still not enough data (at least 4 records) then it will\n      re-calculate, doing an age spread (plus or minus 1 year). There are\n      currently no options for you to adjust minimum records and the spread\n      values.\n    \n\n    \n      If after all this, a suitable race time can't be found, then the\n      TimeToBeat is left empty. This effectively places the swimmer in the\n      slowest heats.\n    \n\n    \n      For a more comprehensive discussion on the workings of TTB follow this...\n      link.\n    \n
