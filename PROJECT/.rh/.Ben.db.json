For example, when using the Nominate, Marshall and Timekeeper applications. Remote access will require a user name and password.\n  \nIf 'Use OS Authentication' is checked then the users Windows login will be used.

Use the Club Members button and add your members.\n      \n      Get yourself comfortable, this is going to take some time. Good news - you only do this once. Minimum requirements are FirstName, LastName, DOB and Gender.\n      \n       \n    \n    Add a new \"Session\" in the \"Session Table\". With that session selected ...\n        \n        TIP: A short note makes the session memorable. eg.'Clear skies and bar-b-que'.\n      \n       \n    \n    Add your events into the \"Events Table\" by entering \"Distance\" and \"Stroke\". \n      \n      If you need to describe your events. Click the Expander button to expand the event grid. The 'description' column is now visible. Any text entered here will be seen by everyone and displayed in every report.\n      \n       \n    \n    Select the next tab-sheet - Nominate. Here you select the swimmer then check the events they will be swimming.\n      \n      If you need to know if they are 'Qualified' to swim the event. Toggle the 'Qualified' button on.\n      \n       \n    \n    Select the next tab-sheet - Heats. Press the Build Heats button for each event. Be aware, your database, at this stage, is totally empty. So your swimmers will not be 'matched-up' correctly. (See the special note below.) \n      \n      TIP: There's a 'build all heats' in the menu bar.\n      \n       \n    \n    You are ready to print the marshal and time-keepers' forms.\n      \n      TIP: If the 'print-set' button isn't enough, there's a 'print all marshal and timekeeper forms' in the menu bar. But beware, the windows print spooler is probably turned on and that's a lot of printer jobs! \n      \n       \n    \n    When a heat has been swum - enter the swimmers' times into the \"race time'' column.\n      \n      Use the arrow-down or tab-key to move to the next race time.\n      \n       \n    \n    When the session is completed, print the session report to PDF and email.\n      \n      TIP: Check-out the 'qualified swimmers report' in tools >> qualification times... >> reports. \n    \n  \n  That it.\n   \n  \n    \n     \n       \n            \n            \n           Here's a link to a short YouTube Video that takes you through the above process in detail.\n          \n          .....

Populate that session with every type of event imagineable. Then fill selected events with your member's personal best race-times. That way when the very first SCM club night is played ... entrants are correctly placed. This also a useful technique to introduce new members into your club, that join late in the season.\n   \n  Next step : Important: How to backup your data.\n\n","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/Interface/SCM_InnoLeftPanel.bmp","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Interface/SCM_InnoLeftPanel.bmp"},{"origLink":"Home.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm"},{"origLink":"#","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm"},{"origLink":"Start_Up.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Start_Up.htm"}],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::Glossary":["Default_SCM_","Default_IT"],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::Author":"BSA","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::Title":"Intro_indx","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::Description":"SwimClubMeet home page.","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::Status":"In Progress","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::Keywords":"home page,introduction","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"introduction, startpage","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Home.htm::InnerText":"\n  The SwimClubMeet application.\n  What is SwimClubMeet (SCM ).\n  It's an application to manage your swimming club members and organize it's club nights.\n  Manage your members, get swimming events set, nominate swimmers, auto-build heats, record race times, organize marshals and time keepers.\n  To get started all you need is a laptop and printer.\n  SCM is scalable.

The order of the heats is slowest to fastest, with the girl swimming prior to the boys.\n            if Exclude outside lanes is checked then gutter lanes will not be used in events.

The membership table is inspected and the members are organised into heats based on type. This is one way to collectively gather swimmers in broad age group categories.

The more data the better.\n  \n\n\nTimeToBeat is always calculated based on the events swum up to but excluding the current session. Data outside of these bounds is ignored.\n  \n\n\nTimeToBeat is calculated actively, in real time. By default it uses the average of the 3 fastest times the member has swum. Alternatively it can use the last known race time or the member's personal best .\n  \nIf a member doesn't have any \nrace time data, then a time is calculated based on the mean average of the bottom 50% (default), with consideration to age and gender. If there is still insufficient data it'll ignore gender. It there is still not enough data (default:  at least 4 records) then it will re-calculate, doing an age spread (default: plus or minus 1 year).\n  \nIf after all this process time, a suitable race time can't be found, then the \nTimeToBeat is left empty. (For an Auto-Build Heats, this effectively sends that swimmer to the slowest heats.)\n  \nThis algorithm can be set in \n\nTools - \nOptions - \n\nTTB \n\n.\n  \nAlso, 'on-the-fly', when doing an Auto-Build Heats \n\n.\n  \n \n  \n\nNotes for Auto-Build Heats:\n  \n\nTimeToBeat is used to select the heat and lane that a member will be given. In the moment that the Auto-Build button is pressed, all TTBs are calculated for all nominees for the given event, in real time. The data used is all the race times of all members that pre-dates the selected session. The TTB data is used to build a list of entrants, fastest to slowest. Those without a T\nTB will end at the bottom of this list and placed \ninto the slowest heat. A new member, without a race history, may be incorrectly place for the first instance but once a race has been swum and their race time data is entered, that member will always be placed correctly.\n  \n \n  \n\nIf you want to 'kick-start' your TimeToBet algorithm (you have just installed the application and you have no data) then you could add a session that is dated prior to the new swimming season. Populate that session with events, filled with the personal best times for all of your members. That way when the first club night is played ... entrants are correctly placed.\n  \n \n\n","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"Application_List.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Application_List.htm"},{"origLink":"Connection_Overview.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm"},{"origLink":"Connecting_SCM.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connecting_SCM.htm"},{"origLink":"How_seeding_works.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm"},{"origLink":"TTB_How_it_works.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/TTB_How_it_works.htm"},{"origLink":"Version_Info.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Version_Info.htm"}],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm::Title":"System_Idx","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/System_Info.htm::InnerText":"\n  System Information\n  Application List\n  Connection Overview\n  Connecting TCP/IP for SCM\n  How seeding works.\n  How TimeToBeat works.\n  Version information.\n   \n  \n    \n     \n       \n            \n            \n           SwimClubMeet color ledger. \n       \n    \n  \n  On screen text or menu item that needs your focus.\n  Action :: On screen button to click or keyboard action to press.\n  Hint, note or info.

We are looking for 'Protocols for SQLEXPRESS'\n  \n  Ensure  'TCP/IP' is enable.\n  Computer Management - Set TCP/IP configuration.\n  Double click 'TCP/IP' (found under the column 'Protocol Name') to open the Properties panel.\n  \n  Make sure Listen All is set to Yes.\n  Next - select the IP Addresses tab.\n  \n  We are looking for the 'IPALL'.\n  Blank out the TCP Dynamic Ports by removing it's '0'\n  Put the default SQLEXPRESS server port number '1433' into TCP Port\n  Press OK\n  Computer Management - Restart the SQLEXPRESS server.\n  While in the 'Computer Management', lets restart the SQLEXPRESS server.  \n  Locate 'SQL Server Services' - select it.\n  \n  Next, in right hand panel, select SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS) \n  \n  Right mouse and select 'Restart' from the pop-down menu.\n  Restarting will ensure all of our changes are applied.\n  Ok - if you have made this far then you now have the server listening on port 1433.\n  Next step is to get the SQLEXPRESS database to accept remote logins. Close up any apps and lets move on.\n  Enable TCP logins for the SwimClubMeet database.\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Start the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Connect to your SQLEXPRESS ....\n          Server name: localhost\\SQLEXPRESS  \n          The dot variation, .\\SQLEXPRESS,  is another alternative.\n          Or a fully qualified server name would be the name of your computer name with an attached instance name. As shown in the example.\n           Authentication :\n          Here you can use 'Windows Authentication'. \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Now that you have successfully logged in, the next step is to select the server name (top line).  The right mouse and select Properties from the popup menu\n  \n  With the Server Properties dialogue open, select the 'Security' tab. Then select the radiobutton 'SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode'. Doing this will enable remote login using the server's user accounts.\n  \n  Press OK. This change won't come into effect until we restart the server.\n  Restart the SQLEXPRESS server.\n  Select the server name (top line). Right mouse, but this time select 'Restart' from the popup menu.\n  \n  With that done, the next is to setup the remote login.\n  Setup a 'scmAdmin' SwimClubMeet remote database login.\n  When the SwimClubMeet application 'BuildMeAClub' was ran it created some useful 'Roles', SwimClubMeet Users and a single Login name.\n  Open up the Security branch. You'll see the remote login name scmAdmin. (There are multiply security branches, make sure you have selected the 'root' branch' as shown below.)\n  \n  Currently it's offline and has a random password. Double click scmAdmin.\n  \n  In the generals tab - you'll note, I've disabled 'Enforce password policy'. That way I can enter a 'short' password.\n  Go do the same - enter a  password for your scmAdmin user and then confirm the password by typing it again in the 'Confirm password' editbox.\n  Next we'll check mappings. Select the 'User Mappings' tab. Then select SwimClubMeet and confirm the following ...\n   \n  Make sure the following are checked ...\n  \n    db_datareader\n    db_datawriter\n    public (optional)\n    SCM_Administrator\n  \n  The last one, 'SCM_Administrator' allows the user scmAdmin to do select actions or tasks to the SwimClubMeet tables. 'SCM_Administrator' is a SQLSERVER 'role' definition. Some SCM system tables are in-accessable to scmAdmin. However when running any of the SwimClubMeet application, logged in as scmAdmin, all application functionality is operable. (Later... If you explore in the SwimClubMeet security sub-branch, you'll notice other SCM 'roles'.)\n  One last job. Select the Status tab. Select the radio button 'Enabled' for the 'Login' option.\n  \n  Press OK\n  And that should do it. It shouldn't be necessary to do another restart of the database changes. (?)\n  Close down MSSMS. \n  Set the firewall to allows communications on the port. (UDP, TCP)\n  If you have a virus protection application running - then this will block port 1433, unless enabled.\n  Here are the steps to enable these port when using Windows Defender Firewall.\n  (You maybe using a different firewall/security application. Instructions to setup UDP/TCP will differ.)\n  Type 'Fire' in the Windows search box. Select the 'Windows Defender Firewall' app.\n  Once open, select 'Advance Settings'.\n  \n  Here it is open and I've selected Inbound Rules. You can see I've already made my SQLEXPRESS 1433 TCP inbound rule for the SQLEXPRESS 1433 static port.\n  \n  To create an inbound rule, select Action >> New Rule ...\n  \n  When the dialogue has open, select Port, then click Next\n  \n  We need to do both TCP and UDP. Lets start with UDP. Select the UDP radiobutton. Select 'Specific local ports' and then enter 1433 in the editbox.\n  \n  Click Next\n  \n  Select 'Allow the connection'. Click Next\n  \n  Select all checkboxes (enable across all connections).  Click Next\n  \n  Give it a title, maybe a description then click Finish.\n  RINSE AND REPEAT. Repeat the same procedure for TCP on port 1433.\n  Click Finish\n  Close the defender firewall application. The SQLEXPRESS 1433 port is now open across all connections.\n  NOW WE MUST CHECK\n  Does the login work locally? Lets test that out.\n  Close all apps. (DO A REBOOT, ENSURE EVERTHING IS INITIALISED)\n  Run SwimClubMeet and try this login...\n  \n  Did it work? Can you edit, delete, move stuff about? If it's worked - then your scmAdmin user is up and running.\n  Now we'll attempt to use the Loop-Back feature to test an IP connection. Disconnect from Wi-Fi. Remove ethernet cable, etc. (Restart PC?) Then try this... \n  \n  Note the comma after the IP address, then the static port number 1433. Did it work? This isn't a solid test for IP connectivity - but it's a good indicator all is well. \n  LIFT OFF\n  Well you are ready for the real world now. Get connected via local Wi-Fi, physical router or the internet! \n  AFTER CONNECTION  - Check your server IP address in Computer Management - Protocols for SQLEXPRESS (typically IP4 or IP6) . \n  You can also use ipconfig at the command line tool to find your current computer's ip address - the SQLEXPRESS server should be using these addresses. (?)\n  On the computer connecting ...\n  \n    Prepare it's firewall to allow communications on port 1433 .\n    When logging in, use the IP address and port of the (remote) SQLEXPRESS server.\n    Login with username scmAdmin and password.\n  \n  Router Configuration..\n  Important notes: \n  Wi-Fi routers will need 'Port Forwarding' enabled for the 1433 port. (both TCP UDP) \n  Your router acts as DNS and assigns IP adresses to each connection. Most routers have a setting to 'lease' a fixed IP address to the same computer on connection. The 'lease time' can be hours or 'forever'. Consider setting the lease time for computer with the MS SQL server to 'forever'. That way the login IP address will always be same. \n  As each router is different, sorry no help session, instead refer to your router's manual..\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/ConnectingSCM.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/ConnectingSCM.png"}],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Author":"Ben Ambrose","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Title":"Connection Overview","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Description":"Schematic ","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Connection_Overview.htm::InnerText":"\n  Connection Overview\n  Here is a visual guide to connecting the SCM applications and an overview of system settings. \n  Ideally three computers would be a good start. 2 computers with touch screens (Microsoft edge pro) and a 'pimp-out' computer (a lap top with 4-8MG of RAM -

Seed method.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Overview of options ...\n  TTB is used to build a list of entrants, ordered by fastest to slowest.  These calculated race times will determine which heat and lane a swimmer is given.\n  1. The entrant's Time-To-Beat \n  You are given three options to calculate the time-to-beat for each entrant. These options require that the entrant have previously raced the event. ie. there is historical data. The default is 'Use the average of the 3 fastest race times'. Only data that pre-dates the current selected session is used.\n  2. Estimate a Time-To-Beat \n  This section of the dialogue can create a time-to-beat for an entrants with no historical race data.  By default, this is enabled. There is no good reason to disable this feature, other than to improve the DB Server performance.\n  The algorithm does this.\n  A. List all the swimmers of the same age and gender who have swum the event. Use only the bottom 50% and get the average time. If this fails (no data, or there is less than 4 swimmers) go to step B.\n  B. List all the swimmers of the same age - ignore gender ... rinse and repeat. If this fails go to step C.\n  C. List all the swimmers in an age bracket (currently set at : plus/minus 1 year) ... rinse and repeat. If this fails, step D.\n  D. Give this swimmer a race time of NULL. This swimmer will be placed in the slowest heat.\n  If you have a lot of data - many years of club nights - then it's time to tweak the percentage. I suggest dropping it over time to 30 percent. Typically, swimmers in untrialled events under-preform. Email me if I'm wrong.  \n  3. Special Options.\n  Seperate gender. For each gender, a list of entrants will be made, ordered fastest to slowest. Each list will be given seperate heats. eg. Split male and female into seperate heats. Said differently, boys don't race the girls.\n  Exclude gutter lanes. If checked, swimmers will not be placed in the outside lanes. eg. If you have an 8 lane pool - well now you have only 6. Helpful if you have ladders that protude in the side lanes.\n  4. Group by..\n  Another way to group entrants. Fine tune the stacking of entrant numbers across heats.\n  \n    Don't group ... disables group by.\n    Entrant's age ... swimmers with the same age are placed in the same heat. May produce a large amount of heats.\n    Membership type ... swimmers of the same membership type are placed in the same heat.\n  \n  5. Seed Method\n  A full description of seeding (with diagrams) is given here.\n  But in a 'nut-shell'.\n  SwimClubMeet (default). After filters and grouping, the resultant entrants are placed in a list fastest to slowest.  Fastest swimmers swim the last heat. Slowest are in the first heat.\n  For a eight lane pool - Swimmers are scattered as per Olymic Standards 4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 1, 8. Fastest swimmer swims lane 4. Slowest swimmer in lane 8.\n  Circle Seeding. Gets a little more complicated. Say you have 8 lanes and 4 heats. Your seed depth is 2.\n  After filters and grouping, the resultant entrants are placed in a list fastest to slowest. Fastest heat is heat 4. Slowest is heat 1.\n  Only heats 3 and 4 are circle seeded. Heats 1 and 2 use the default seeding.\n  The fastest swimmer goes into heat 4 lane 4. The 2nd Fastest swimmer is placed in heat 3 lane 4. The 3rd fastest is place in heat 4 lane 5. The fourth fastest is placed in heat 4 lane 5. And so on .... \n  Why use circle seeding? By mixing up the ranked swimmers, it'll change the racing dynamics and 'freshen-up' the competition. Just another reason why you want to go to 'Club Night'.\n  Circle seeding is best used on events with a large number of entrants. \n  Special Note.\n  Any changes made in this dialogue become the new default settings used by  SCM. Said differently - settings are mirrored in the Tool Options dialogue.\n  Learn more  ...\n  TTB is also mirrored in Options.   \n  Auto-Build is also mirrored in Options.  \n  Follow the link to a summary of TTB.    \n\n","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/SeedA.JPG","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SeedA.JPG"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/SeedB.JPG","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SeedB.JPG"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/SeedingD.jpg","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SeedingD.jpg"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/SeedC.JPG","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/SeedC.JPG"}],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Title":"How seeding works","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/How_seeding_works.htm::InnerText":"\n  How seeding works\n  Here's an illustrated explanation of seeding lanes.\n  Some ground rules.\n  Olympic standards determine which lanes competitors are scattered into. The order for an eight lane pool goes something like this .... 4,5,3,6,2,7,1,8. The algorithm used in SCM will correctly scatter for any sized pool. Even pools with an odd number of lanes.\n  Consider this ...\n  \n  Each square represents a swimmer. Fastest swimmer is green, intermediate yellow, slowest red. A total of 32 swimmers will require four heats in an eight lane pool.\n  Default seeding. (This algorithm is also used by 'Finals' seeding).\n  \n  The illustrate shows that the all top eight fastest swimmers have been placed in heat four. All the slowest swimmers are in the heat one.\n  Circle seeding. (Also used by 'Quarter' and 'Semi'- Finals').\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n          Circle seeding is selected.\n          In this example the seed depth will be set to two. This means the two fastest heats, three and four, will be circle seed.\n          The heats one and two will use the default seed method.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  Note: SwimClubMeet first builds a stack of swimmers, fastest to slowest. Calculates the number of heats and count of swimmers needed. Then it builds heats, fastest to slowest. Hence circle seeding is top down.\n  \n  It can be seen that there is now a 'spread' of fastest swimmers in heats four and three. Your fastest swimmer is in heat four. the second fastest swimmer in heat three. They both are given lane four.\n  Perchance - entrant placement in heats two and one are identical to the previous default seeding.\n  Why circle seed?\n  When you have many entrants to an event (say four or five heats) you may want to circle seed to improve the racing experience for your top contenders.\n  It's recommended that you don't exceed a depth of three. The racing experience (a club level) for bottom ranked swimmers isn't improved if you go beyond three. \n  Other notes\n  When creating a 'FINAL' the default seeding is used. This a system default, SCM managed. Your seed settings in options are ignored. \n  When creating a 'SEMI' or 'QUARTER-FINAL' circle seeding is used. (... again SCM managed)\n\n","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"#","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm"},{"origLink":"Build_Heats_Dialogue.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Build_Heats_Dialogue.htm"},{"origLink":"Quick_Pick.htm#QuickPickEntrant","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Quick_Pick.htm"},{"origLink":"Quick_Pick.htm#QuickPickMember","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Quick_Pick.htm"}],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm::Glossary":["Default_SCM_"],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm::Title":"xDialogs_idx","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm::TopicIndexKeywords":"controls outline","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/xDialogs/Special_Controls.htm::InnerText":"\n  More details on special dialogues.\n  This section contains additional information on some of the special dialogues used by SCM.\n  \n    Auto-Build\n    Quick-Pick Entrant\n    Quick-Pick Member\n    Audit membership dialogue\n  \n   \n\n","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"}],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm::Title":"Keyboard shortcuts","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/System/Keyboard_shortcuts.htm::InnerText":"\n    This is Body Placeholder text for your Master Page.

These tables will appear grayed to indicate their read-only state. Most controls for these tables are also grayed. However, you can still navigate events and print reports. Locking a session protects your data from accidential entry.\n  To un-lock a session, toggle the button.\n   New Session Button\n  Click the new button to create a new session. The 'create new session' dialogue appears. Enter a session date and starting time. You can also enter a session description or comment if you wish. These descriptions appear in reports.\n   Delete Session Button.\n  Deleting a session will delete all events, nominations, heats and entrant data. You will be prompted,  'do you wish to delete the session'. If your session contains race times you will be prompted a second time. There is no-undo.\n  A locked session cannot be deleted. This button will appear grayed if you have selected a locked session.\n   Session Report Button\n  Click this button to produces a session report ordered by event.\n  Cntrl-Click this button to produces a session report ordered by member.\n  The first page on each report gives the session date. All pages are numbered and displayed in the footer.\n  Each report displays race time (if entrant times have been entered), Personal Best (the entrant's fastest swimming time - prior to this session) and DIFF.\n  The DIFF or difference value is a negative or positive and shows the performance improvement, or not, for the event. A negative amount is what every swimmer wants to see.\n   Session Report Examples. \n  Clicking the  Session Rpt* button produces a reports for the current selected session - ordered by event and heat.\n  \n  Clicking    CTRL-Session Rpt* produces a report of the current selected session - ordered by member's LastName.\n  \n  Event Report Examples\n  Clicking the Event Rpt* button produces a report showing all the events for the current selected session.\n  \n  Clicking  CNTRL-Event Rpt* produces a report of the current selected event and displays all the heats and members for that event.\n  .\n\n","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::Links":[{"origLink":"../../assets/css/default.css","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm","nodeName":"link","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/css/default.css"},{"origLink":"../../assets/masterpages/SCM.htt","attr":"content","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm","nodeName":"meta","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/masterpages/SCM.htt"},{"origLink":"../../assets/images/Interface/SCM_GroupOfIcons.png","attr":"src","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm","nodeName":"img","external":false,"relPath":"contents/assets/images/Interface/SCM_GroupOfIcons.png"},{"origLink":"../Interface/Interface.htm","attr":"href","topic":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm","nodeName":"a","external":false,"relPath":"contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Interface/Interface.htm"}],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::Variables":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::Conditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::TopicConditions":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::IndexKeywords":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::Glossary":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::Bookmarks":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::MicrocontentResponse":[],"Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::Author":"Ben Ambrose","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::Title":"LearnMore","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::Description":"Compare SCM to other swimming applications","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::Status":"Draft","Path::contents/SCM_SwimClubMeet/Intro/Learn_more.htm::InnerText":"\n  Learn More.\n  Why is SCM best suited to local swimming clubs?\n  Your local swimming club differs from a large competitive event in many ways.\n  Typically a local swim club look like this ...\n  Nominations for events happens at the pool gate. Parents are keen to get the event's started so they can get the kids home and to bed, but the night start's slowly, there's a cue to nominate.\n  Most club's have small membership numbers, say 50-80 swimmers, so it's normal to mix gender and ages into individual heats.   \n  Parents are given the jobs of timekeeper or marshal. And someone is sitting in a corner, with a laptop, setting the meet up, probably into a spread sheet. There's lots of paper being couriered around the pool.\n  What's needed ...\n  Quickly get members nominated.\n    A simple way to nominate.\n    A single button to build heats.\n    Remove printer ink and paper.\n    Collect timekeeper's race-times easily.\n    Store and archive some basic member's details. (name, age, gender and swimming history.)\n    Tabulate a report of the night's session .\n  SCM's charter.\n  SCM is focused on 'what is needed' and most importantly, keep it simple. \n  Just getting started .... (I have just a lap-top and printer)\n  SwimClubMeet is the core app - it does it all. It creates sessions and events, nominate and Auto-Builds all your heats, enter race-times. It also manages members details. It does reporting.  \n  It'll print-out all the forms you need. Such as the Marshall's rally sheet and Timekeeper's entry sheet. At the end of the night you can create a session report for distribution to parent and friends.\n  If you have the resources ... Wi-Fi, more than one computer (touch screen?) \n  Got two computers and a hub or wi-fi. Connect the two, share the SQL server and run SwimClubMeet on both. Nominate swimmers twice as fast.\n  Go one step further ...\n  Then there's the support applications.\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          SCM gives you a simple kiosk type app for members to self-nominate at the entry gate. (Designed for MS Surface PRO)\n          You may wish to use the Marshall and Timekeeper apps for a paperless club night. (Designed for MS Surface PRO).\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Currently in development\n  A stand-alone app just to manage membership data, should you wish to delegate tasks.\n  A leader-board app to track swimmer and house scores, in real time. (for you club's end-of-season finals)\n  Future ideas and plans\n  A SCM_Stats package. Lots of charts and stats, for the annual committee meeting.\n    A SCM_Carnival application to make it easy for neighboring clubs to challenge each other to a 'swim-off'.\n    A SCM_Report package for some additional forms, for example, bar-coded membership cards, accreditation and podium certificates, etc.\n    A SCM_PreNominate app that uses email and PDF data-forms. Fully automated. (Avoids using web services, keeps it simple).\n    \n    All developement of SCM is being done on a cross-platform compiler. This means that Android and iOS versions of nominate, marshal and timekeeper application will eventually be delivered.\n  \n  Help documentation\n  SCM includes documentation on all it's features. This is a work-in-progress. There is also an online version which is updated regularly.\n  Start the journey ... the SwimClubMeet Interface.\n   \n  \n    \n     \n       \n            \n            \n           SCM is created by just the one developer.

Refresh.\n            An important button if you are using the support apps (Marshall, Nominate, TimeKeeper, etc). As these external apps can change data within you Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS SwimClubMeet database, this refresh button re-syncs the core app.\n            The core application does auto-resync at set points in the code. For example : When you move between tabsheets it will requery tables pertaining to the tabsheet you selected. The refresh button is a more inclusive, an all incompassing re-sync. \n            Here are some examples when a refresh might be in order: \n              👉 If the Marshall disqualifies swimmers, then after a re-fresh you'll see the heat display check marks in the disqualified box.\n              👉 If the Timekeeper enters swimmers race times, then after a re-fresh, those times will appears in each entrant's lane.\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n     \n      \n              \n             Tip: To keep all connections to the database in sync, It's good practice to formulate or agree upon a 'race running procedure'. \n              \n            For example: Assuming we are using SCM_Marshal and SCM_TimeKeeper apps. Someone has been tasked to collect all the race times and enter them using the SCM_timeKeeper app.\n              \n              After the timekeeper signals to the marshal that all race times are in, then the marshal may set the heat status as raced. The marshal flags the SCM administrator who refreshes the core application. Does a 'Q&A' to check all the race times are indeed accounted for. Then closes the heat.\n       \n    \n  \n   \n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n             \n

It reacts in real time to your key strokes. To see the\n      full list again, clear the search editbox.\n    \n    \n      The\n      TimeToBeat, age and gender give you useful information on whom to pick, when\n      manually constructing a heat.\n    \n    \n      Double click on the chosen record to\n      place the nominee into the lane. Else click the\n      post button. As expected, the\n      cancel button closes the dialogue\n      without any changes being made.\n    \n    \n      If you are re-assigning swimmers. Then the swimmer who has been\n      'bumped' out of their lane is returned to the nominees list,\n      awaiting a lane assignment.\n    \n    \n      The process works on blank lanes - you can fill a blank lane with a\n      nominee. But to empty a lane of it's entrant, use the\n      empty lane button.\n    \n    \n      Once the assignment is done and the dialogue closes, to exit 'edit\n      mode', either tab or\n      click outside the CELL. Exiting\n      edit-mode finalizes the change.\n    \n    \n      Ellipse button.

Doing so has\n      set the CELL to edit mode. Yet another way to enter edit mode is to use\n      the keyboard short-cut f2.\n    \n    \n      This CELL uses a template to assist you in entering time. The  '\n      :', '\n      .' characters\n      cannot be type over.

If you want to enter 31 seconds and 41/100ths, do this, type\n      003141. There is no need to type the '\n      :', '\n      .' characters.\n    \n    \n      Entering an invalid time, for example 01:62.20, will be ignored. You\n      can't have 62 seconds! The race time will revert when you exit\n      edit-mode - ignoring your erronous entry. Note: you aren't prompted\n      with an error message. Double check your race times.\n    \n    \n      To finalize your changes, exit edit-mode by pressing \n      tab or\n      enter or\n      arrow up or\n      arrow down or\n      click outside the CELL.\n    \n    \n      To clear a race time, select all and press the\n      backspace key. The race time will be set\n      to zero. When you exit edit-mode the CELL will be painted blank.\n    \n    \n      The TimeKeepers application can set a swimmer's race time remotely.\n    \n    \n      Most human timekeepers aren't the best at recording 1000ths.
