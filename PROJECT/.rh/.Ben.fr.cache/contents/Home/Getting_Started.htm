  Getting your first swim night running.
  Here's an outline of what needs to be done to get started. 
  
    You need swimmers. Use the Club Members button and add your members.
       
    Add a new "Session" in the "Session Table". With that session selected ...
       
    Add "Events" in the "Events Table" by entering "Distance" and "Stroke". 
       
    Select "Nominate". Here you select the swimmer then check the events they will be swimming.
       
    Select "Heats". Press the Build Heats button for each event. (Or "build all heats" via the menu bar)
       
    You are ready to print the marshal and time-keepers' forms.
       
    When a heat has been swum - enter the swimmers' times into the "RaceTime'' column.
    
    When the session is run, print the session report.
  
  That it. 
   
  Special note:
  If you want to 'kick-start' your TimeToBet algorithm (you have just installed the application and you have no race data) add a new session that is dated prior to the new swimming season. Populate that session with events, filled with the personal best times for all of your members. That way when the very first club night is played ... entrants are correctly placed.
