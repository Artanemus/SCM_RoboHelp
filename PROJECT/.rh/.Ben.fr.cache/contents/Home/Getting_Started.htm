  Getting your first swim night running.
  Here's an outline of what needs to be done to get started. 
  
    You need swimmers. Use the Club Members button and add your members.
       
    Add a new "Session" in the "Session Table". With that session selected ...
       
    Add your events into the "Events Table" by entering "Distance" and "Stroke". 
       
    Select the next tab-sheet - Nominate. Here you select the swimmer then check the events they will be swimming.
       
    Select the next tab-sheet - Heats. Press the Build Heats button for each event. (Or "build all heats" via the menu bar) Be aware, your database, at this stage, is totally empty. So your swimmers will not be 'matched-up' correctly. (See the special note below.) 
       
    You are ready to print the marshal and time-keepers' forms.
       
    When a heat has been swum - enter the swimmers' times into the "RaceTime'' column.
    
    When the session is completed, print the session report to PDF and email.
  
  That it. 
   
  Special note:
  If you want to 'kick-start' your TimeToBet algorithm (you have just installed the application and you have no race data) add a new session that is dated prior to the new swimming season. Populate that session with every type of event. Then fill selected events with the personal best race-times for each of your members. That way when the very first SCM club night is played ... entrants are correctly placed. This also works for new members that join late in the season.
