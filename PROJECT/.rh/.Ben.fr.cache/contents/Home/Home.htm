  The SwimClubMeet application.
  What is SwimClubMeet (SCM ).
  It's an application to manage your swimming club members and organize it's 'Club Nights'. It is exclusively written to run your local swimming club.
  Manage your members, get swimming events setup, nominate swimmers, auto-build heats, record race times, organise marshalls and time keepers.
  SCM is also future proof, it's scalable. Have multi-points from which to nominate. Have members "self-nominate" using touch pad, kiosk style entry. Run paperless. Connect marshalls and timekeepers via wi-fi. And more.
  Get your Club's swimming sessions running smoothly.
  It does one job, has a clean, simple interface. That's why it easy to use. Perfect for parents and friends who aren't IT experts.
