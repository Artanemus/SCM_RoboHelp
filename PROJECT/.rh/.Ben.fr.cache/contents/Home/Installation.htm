  INSTALLATION IN DETAIL
  
    Install Microsoft SQL Server Express
      
      There's heaps of videos and help files on the internet that will show you how to install MS SQLEXPRESS. Typing 'ms sql express download'  into Google search generally gets you the correct page.
      
      It's recommened that you make a note of your server name (or instance) once the installation is complete .
    
    Install Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) (optional)
      
      It's been noted that the latest sqlexpress installation will offer you the option to include SSMS with it's install. 
      
      This can be used to backup your SCM database. (Or use a PowerShell script. But that's for geeks and IT experts.)
       
    
    Run the SCM_BuildMeAClub installation file. This will installl the BuildMeAClub app and SQL scripts needed to build the SwimClubMeet database on the SQLEXPRESS database server. After the installation is completed, type 'buildme' in the search bar to find the application. Then run it.
    
    Run the SwimClubMeet installer. This will install SwimClubMeet.
    
  
  For the next basic steps go to your first club night with SCM.
