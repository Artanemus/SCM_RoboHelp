      SSMS is an integrated environment for managing any SQL infrastructure, from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database. SSMS provides tools to configure, monitor, and administer instances of SQL. Use SSMS to deploy, monitor, and upgrade the data-tier components used by your applications, as well as build queries and scripts.
      
      Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to query, design, and manage your databases and data warehouses, wherever they are - on your local computer, or in the cloud.
      
      You'll be use this application to backup your SCM database.
