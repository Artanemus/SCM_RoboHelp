  1. Club name and nickname.
  The name of the swimming organization/association and it's nickname.
  Future versions of SCM will include the club's logo. 
  2. Tabs.
  Session, Nominate, Heats
  3. Scary System Info.
  This area of the panel can show additional information (if enabled).
  For user's who wish to track a record through the MSSQL SwimClubMeet database then DB record information can be displayed. Enabled/disabled in Tools... Options... Other... System: 'Show debug information'.
  If you are a power-user and understand MSSQL T-SQL language, then this may assist you in writting your query. I know it helps me (the programmer) to debug and track errors.
  4. Member's dialogue.
  This button gives access to the member's dialogue. Here you can create a new members, enter data for each member, track a member's attendance, visualize a member's performance and more. See .... LINK
  5. Refresh.
  An important button if you are using the support apps (Marshall, Nominate, TimeKeeper). As these external apps can change data within you MSSQL SwimClubMeet database, this refresh button re-syncs the core app.
  For example. if the Marshall disqualifies a swimmer, then after a re-fresh you'll see the entrant table with a checkmark for the disqualified.
  For example. If the timekeeper enters a swimmers racetime, then after a re-fresh, that time appears in the entrant table.
  As a general rule: agree on the procedure.
  eg. after the Marshall has signalled that the heat has been 'raced'. Then it's time for a re-fresh, check you have all the racetimes, then close the heat.
