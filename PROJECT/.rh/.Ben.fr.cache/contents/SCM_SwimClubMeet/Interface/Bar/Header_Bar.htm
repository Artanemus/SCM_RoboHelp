               5. Refresh.
              
                An important button if you are using the support apps (Marshal,
                Nominate, Timekeeper, etc). As these external apps can change
                data within you Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS SwimClubMeet database,
                this refresh button re-syncs the core app.
              
              
                The core application does auto-resync at set points in the code.
                For example : When you move between tabsheets it will
                requery tables pertaining to the tabsheet you selected. The
                refresh button is a more inclusive, an all incompassing
                re-sync. 
              
              
                Here are some examples when a refresh might be in order: 
                ðŸ‘‰ If the Marshal disqualifies swimmers, then after a re-fresh
                you'll see the heat display check marks in the disqualified
                box.
                ðŸ‘‰ If the Timekeeper enters swimmers race times, then after a
                re-fresh, those times will appears in each entrant's lane.
              
            
          
        
      
    
    
    
      
        
          
        
         Tip:
      
      
        If you are running in paperless mode, that is, your are using the
        support applications SCM_Marshal and
        SCM_Timekeeper , it's good to instigate
        some pool procedure.
      
      
        A heat is considered raced when the
        Referee blows the whistle. The Chief Marshal or Referee can set the heat
        status to raced  by using the
        SCM_Marshal application..
      
      
        A heat is considered closed when all the
        race time data has been entered into the database.
      
      
        Race-times can be entered by the Chief Timekeeper at the poolside by
        using the SCM_Timekeeper application. They
        can't close the heat, only the core
        application can do that.
      
      
        After the Referee flags the heat is over the Chief Recorder does an
        Q&A and then closes the heat.
