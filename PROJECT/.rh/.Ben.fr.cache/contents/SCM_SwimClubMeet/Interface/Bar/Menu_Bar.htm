              Import XLS ...
              
                TBA. Imports an XLS into
                SCM as a session. The XLS must have the correct SCM header else
                import will fail. The date and time of the newly created session
                will match the creation date of the XLS.  An 'Export
                XLS' will always import successfully.
                
                Future extension to SCM will include an application that allows
                for the injection of new members and their historical data via
                an XLS import. This extension will be a stand-alone application
                for PC only.
              
              Export XLS ... 
              
                TBA. Exports the CarnivalMeet data but in XLS format. This is a
                multi-sheet XLS that can be loaded in Microsoft's Excel. The
                file is also useful to gain a snapshot into the club members and
                their performances. Future extensions to SCM will include a
                coaching application that can also use this raw data.
              
              Import CarnivalMeet ...
              
                TBA. Import your member's events and race-times from
                a Carnival-Meet. The imported data will appear as a session. The
                session date and time will match the date and time of the
                Carnival-Meet. The session will only contain the data for your
                members and not the participating clubs that joined the
                carnival. Nominations and Events that don't include any of
                your club members will still be displayed.
              
              Export CarnivalMeet ...
              
                TBA. Export your members details (clubname, swimmer name,
                gender, DOB) and personal bests (PBs) across all raced events in
                preparation for import into the SCM_CarnivalMeet application.
              
              Exit
              
                Closes the application. There is no need to save as your data is
                continuously written to the
                MSSQL EXPRESS database server.

              New Session...
              
                Create a new club-night. Enter a date and time for your new
                session. Optionally, add a short note to make the night
                memerable. eg. 'Clear skies and bar-b-que'. 
              
              Edit Session...
              
                Opens the edit session dialogue box. Here you can modify date,
                time or note.
              
              
                
                Clone Session ...
              
              
                The current selected session is duplicated and given today's
                date. Useful if you want to copy last weeks club night. Only
                events are carried across. Member's nominations and heats
                are not cloned.
              
              Lock/Unlock
              
                This is a toggle to make the current selected session and
                it's events and heats read-only. The session gets painted
                'tomatoe red' when locked.
              
              Build ALL Heats ...
              
                Takes the nominations and constructs heats for all events in the
                current selected session. Existing heats that are raced or
                closed are not effected by this action. On selection, the
                Auto-Build Heats dialogue is opened. Select your configuration
                for building all heats and press OK.

                Removes all nominations from the selected event. If the nominee
                has been assigned a lane, then they are removed from that lane.
                Should a heat become empty, then the heat is removed.

                👉 Here you can set the qualifying and trial distance (and time)
                to determine whether a member is permitted to swim an event of
                given distance and stroke. It takes into consideration gender
                and pool type (Short or long course).
                👉 Also print qualification reports such as "Who isn't
                qualified, but is swimming the event anyway, despite your best
                efforts!"

                bracketed age groups. But it could be categories for
                'Masters'. Or categoreies for disabled swimmers. By
                default, when you install the core app, it's already
                populated with data. View this data as examples.

                Score your end of year club finals. Score ABSOLUTE, RELATIVE (to
                division). Score the event or each heat. And more. 
              
              
                Score is a work-in-progress. With the release of SCM_LeaderBoard
                it'll be fine tuned. It's layout and input methods may
                change.

              House ...
              
                Create, delete houses. Assign house logos, mottos. Assign
                members to houses. House data can be used by SCM_LeaderBoard to
                display house totals.
              
              
                What's the point of houses in clubs, you ask? Good question.
                None. swim clubs don't need houses.
                
                BUT.... Perhaps your club is in truth a school running a
                swimming carnival. Think about the combine strengths of using
                SCM, Import XLS and the SCM_LeaderBoard
                application.
              
              
                House is work-in-progress. With the release of SCM_LeaderBoard
                it'll a have full meaning.

                🖐 DEVELOPER : If I've written SCM correctly, then it'll
                find nothing. This routine is non-destructive. Comforting to run
