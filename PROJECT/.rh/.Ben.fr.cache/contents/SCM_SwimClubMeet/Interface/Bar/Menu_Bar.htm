            Import XLS ...
            TBA. Imports aÂ 'XLS Export' into SCM as a session. The date and time matches the time of the original export. The XLS must have the correct SCM header else import will fail.
            Export XLS ...Â 
            TBA. Exports the CarnivalMeet data but in XLS format. This is a multi-sheet XLS that can be loaded in Microsoft's Excel. The file is also useful to gain a snapshot into the club members and theirÂ performances. Future extensions to SCM will include a coaching application thatÂ can also use this raw data.
            Import CarnivalMeetÂ ...
            TBA. Import your member's events and race-times from aÂ CarnivalMeet. The imported data will appear as a session. The session date and time will matchÂ the date and time of the Carnival-Meet. The session will only containÂ the data for your members and not the participating swimming club(s) membersÂ that joined in the carnival. Nominations and Events that don't include any of your club members will still be displayed.
            Export CarnivalMeetÂ ...
            TBA. Export your members details (clubname, swimmer name, gender, DOB) andÂ personal bests (PBs) across all raced events in preparation for import into the SCM_CarnivalMeet application.
            Exit
            Closes the application. There is no need to save as yourÂ data is continuously written to the MSSQL EXPRESSÂ database server.
