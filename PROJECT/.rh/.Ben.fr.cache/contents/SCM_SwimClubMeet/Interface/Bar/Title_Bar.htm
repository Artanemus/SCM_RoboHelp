            5. Refresh.
            An important button if you are using the support apps (Marshall, Nominate, TimeKeeper). As these external apps can change data within you Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS SwimClubMeet database, this refresh button re-syncs the core app.
            For example: 
              If the Marshall disqualifies a swimmer, then after a re-fresh you'll see the heat display a check mark in the disqualified box.
              If the Timekeeper enters a swimmers race time, then after a re-fresh, that time appears in the heat.
            To keep all connections to the database in sync, It's good practise to formulate or agree apoun a 'race running procedure'. For example: After the timekeeper signals the marshal that all racetime sare 'in', then the Marshal signals that the heat has been 'raced'. Then the SCM adminiatrator to re-freshes the core application and 'Q&A' that all the race times are accounted for. Only then does the SCM administator closes the heat.
