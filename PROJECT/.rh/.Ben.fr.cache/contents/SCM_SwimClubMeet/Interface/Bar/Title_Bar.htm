            5. Refresh.
            An important button if you are using the support apps (Marshall, Nominate, TimeKeeper, etc). As these external apps can change data within you Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS SwimClubMeet database, this refresh button re-syncs the core app.
            The core application does auto-resync at set points in the code. For example : When you move between tabsheets it will requeryÂ tables pertaining to the tabsheet you selected. The refresh button is a more inclusive, an all incompassing re-sync.Â 
            Here are some examples when a refresh might be in order:Â 
              ðŸ‘‰ If the Marshall disqualifies swimmers, then after a re-fresh you'll see the heat displayÂ check marks inÂ the disqualified box.
              ðŸ‘‰ If the Timekeeper enters swimmers race times, then after a re-fresh, thoseÂ times will appears in eachÂ entrant's lane.
          
        
      
    
  
  
    
     
      
              
            Â Tip: To keep all connections to the database in sync, It's good practice to formulate or agree uponÂ a 'race running procedure'.Â 
              
            For example: Assuming we are using SCM_Marshal and SCM_TimeKeeper apps. Someone has been tasked to collect all the race times and enter them usingÂ the SCM_timeKeeper app.
              
              After theÂ timekeeperÂ signals to the marshal that all race times are in,Â then the marshal mayÂ setÂ the heat status as raced. The marshal flags the SCM administratorÂ who refreshes the core application. Does aÂ 'Q&A' to check all the race times are indeed accounted for.Â Then closes the heat.
