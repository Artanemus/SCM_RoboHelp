  5. Refresh.
  An important button if you are using the support apps (Marshall, Nominate, TimeKeeper). As these external apps can change data within you Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS SwimClubMeet database, this refresh button re-syncs the core app.
  For example. if the Marshall disqualifies a swimmer, then after a re-fresh you'll see the heat display a check mark in the disqualified box.
  For example. If the timekeeper enters a swimmers race time, then after a re-fresh, that time appears in the heat.
  Tip:
  To keep all connections to the database in sync, It's good practise to formulate and agree apoun a 'race running procedure'.
  For example. After the Marshall has signaled that the heat has been 'raced'. Then it's time for the SCM adminiatrator to re-fresh the core application and check that all the race times have 'come-in', then close the heat.
