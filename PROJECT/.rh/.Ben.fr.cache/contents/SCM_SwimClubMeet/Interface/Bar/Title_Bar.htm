            5. Refresh.
            An important button if you are using the support apps (Marshall, Nominate, TimeKeeper, etc). As these external apps can change data within you Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS SwimClubMeet database, this refresh button re-syncs the core app.
            The core application does auto-resync at set points in the code. For example : When you move between tabsheets it will requery tables pertaining to the tabsheet you selected. The refresh button is a more inclusive, an all incompassing re-sync. 
            Here are some examples when a refresh might be in order: 
              👉 If the Marshall disqualifies swimmers, then after a re-fresh you'll see the heat display check marks in the disqualified box.
              👉 If the Timekeeper enters swimmers race times, then after a re-fresh, those times will appears in each entrant's lane.
          
        
      
    
  
  
  
    
         
        Tip:
    If you are running in paperless mode, that is, your are using the support applications SCM_Marshal and SCM_TimeKeeper , it's good to instigate some pool procedure. 
    A heat is considered raced when the Referee blows his whistle. The Chief Marshal or Referee can set the heat status using the SCM_Marshal application.. 
    A heat is considered closed when all the race time data >has been entered into the database. 
    Race-times can be entered by the Chief Timekeeper at the poolside by using the SCM_TimeKeeper application. Only the core application can close heats. 
    After the Referee flags the heat is over the Chief Recorder does an Q&A and then closes the heat.
