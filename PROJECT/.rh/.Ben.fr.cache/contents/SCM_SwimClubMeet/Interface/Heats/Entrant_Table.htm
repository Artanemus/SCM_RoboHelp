  Navigating the entrants table
  Selection is CELL based. Only three cells are editable. They are race time, scratched and disqualified.
  Moving about.
  Arrow keys, UP, DOWN, LEFT and  RIGHT will move across all cells.
  TAB and SHIFT-TAB key will only move to the CELLs that are editable.
  race time - enter edit mode.
  Press ENTER or F2 or CLICK the selected CELL.
  race time - edit mode.
  A template is used in this CELL. Arrow keys allow you to select a time portion, skipping delimeters. DOUBLE CLICK to select all. Only numerical keys are accepted. Select all and then BACKSPACE to zero.
  
  race time - exit edit mode.
  Press ENTER, TAB, SHIFT-TAB. Or click outside the CELL.
  SCRATCHED, DISQUALIFIED
  Pressing the  SPACE key or mouse CLICK will toggle the checkbox.
  Entrant Name Column
  Manual Lane Assignment.
  To manually place a nominee in an empty lane or bump a nominee...
  Select the Entrant's Name CELL of the lane you want to re-assign. A selection box appears around the CELL.
  
  Click the cell once more. Doing so has set the CELL to edit mode. Another way to enter edit mode is to use the keyboard short-cut f2. Yet another way is to use the enter key.
  
  Notice, you can't edit the swimmers name. The only active part is the ellipse button, which is located at the far end of the CELL.
  Ellipse button. Method 1.
   Left mouse click the ellipse button to open the Quick Pick Nominee dialogue.
  For this event ...
  
  The swimmers shown in the list are all nominees that haven't been given a lane. 
  If the list is empty, then ever swimmer that nominated has a lane.
  Clicking a column heading will sort by that column. Click again will invert the sort order.
  If the list is very long, then use the search editbox to narrow it down. It used wildcards, so you only need to enter a part or snippet of a nominee's name. It reacts in real time to your key strokes. To see the full list again, clear the search editbox.
  The TimeToBeat, age and gender give you useful information on whom to pick, when manually constructing a heat.
  Double click on the chosen record to place the nominee into the lane. Else click the post button. As expected, the cancel button closes the dialogue without any changes being made.
  If you are re-assigning swimmers. Then the swimmer who has been 'bumped' out of their lane is returned to the nominees list, awaiting a lane assignment.
  The process works on blank lanes - you can fill a blank lane with a nominee. But to empty a lane of it's entrant, use the empty lane button.
  Once the assignment is done and the dialogue closes, to exit 'edit mode', either tab or click outside the CELL. Exiting edit-mode finalizes the change.
  Ellipse button. Method 2.
      Cntrl-left mouse click the cell's Ellipse button to open the Quick Pick Member dialogue.
  The dialogue is very simular. Note the title on the caption bar is different, and list is significantly larger.
  All active club members who swim appear in this list. With the exception of swimmers who have been given a lane in the event. 
  Functionality is identical to the previous dialogue.
  The magic done here is this... if you assign a member to a lane then you have also  nominated that member for the event. 'Two birds with one stone'. You created both a nominee and an entrant.
  Moving Entrants 
   To move entrants to a different lane, select the lane with the entrant you wish to move, click the arrow up or arrow down buttons. This works for empty lanes too.
  To move an entrant into the previous or next heat, continue pressing the arrow up or arrow down buttons.
  The keyboard short-cuts are ctrl-up and ctrl-down.
  Us the  Switch Lanes button as an alternative method to swap an entrant between lanes and events. 
  More entrant table columns.
  Lane#
  A read-only CELL. The pool's lane number. The number of lanes that appears in the table is determined by 
  Tools ... Options ... Club ... Number of lanes  
  race time
  It's in this CELL that you enter a swimmer's time for racing the event.
  Select the CELL by  Tab or  mouse click, a selection box appears arround the CELL.
  
  Press enter or Click the cell once more. Doing so has set the CELL to edit mode. Yet another way to enter edit mode is to use the keyboard short-cut f2.
  This CELL uses a template to assist you in entering time. The  ' :', ' .' characters cannot be type over. Use the  left and right arrow keys to navigate. Double click to select all.
  The quickest method to entering race times is to select all, then start typing. If you want to enter 31 seconds and 41/100ths, do this, type 003141. There is no need to type the ' :', ' .' characters.
  Entering an invalid time, for example 01:62.20, will be ignored. You can't have 62 seconds! The race time will revert when you exit edit-mode - ignoring your erronous entry. Note: you aren't prompted with an error message. Double check your race times.
  To finalize your changes, exit edit-mode by pressing  tab or enter or arrow up or arrow down or click outside the CELL.
  To clear a race time, select all and press the backspace key. The race time will be set to zero. When you exit edit-mode the CELL will be painted blank.
  The TimeKeepers application can set a swimmer's race time remotely.
  Most human timekeepers aren't the best at recording 1000ths. The reason SwimClubMeet accepts this precision is to prepare itself for electronic touch-pads. A future addition.
  TODO: race time additional keyboard short-cuts : CTRL-A select all. CTRL-C copy to clipboard. CTRL-P paste from clipboard. CTRL-X cut (clear) race time. Warning message or visual indicator for illegal race times.
  TimeToBeat
  This is a read only calculated field.  SCM  has determined that the entrant will most likely swim the event in this time (based on historical data).

  D
  If checked this indicates the entrant has been disqualified by the race marshall. The Marshall's application can set this remotely.
  S
  If checked this indicates the entrant was scratched from the event. (A no-show.) The Marshall's application can set this remotely.
