            Event Navigator
            Displays ...
            Event number.
              Distance.
              Stroke.
              Navigation buttons.
              Event description (if given).
              Swimming stroke silhouette.
            To move between events, use the arrow buttons.
            Note: the navigator synchronizes with the Event Grid on tabsheet 1. Moving to a different event will also move the event grid's record locator. And visa-versa.
