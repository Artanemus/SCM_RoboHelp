          This section describes how to manually build heats using the
          ellipse button and hand placing nominees.
        
      
    
    
      
        
      
    
    
      Note that in the Entrant's Name cell, you
      can't edit the swimmer's name. The only active part is the
      ellipse button, which is located at the far
      end of the cell.
    
    
      The ellipse button has two methods activated by
      LMOUSE click or
      CNTRL+LMOUSE click.
    

    
    
      
        
          
          
        
        Info: To navigate too the ellipse button, use the mouse. Select the
        swimmer (or empty lane), then the ellipse will appear.
      
    

    
    Ellipse button. Method 1.
    
      LMOUSE click the ellipse button to open the
      Quick Pick Nominee dialogue.
    

    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            
              The swimmers listed in this dialogue are all nominees that haven't
              been given a lane in the current selected event.
            
            
              If the quick-pick list is empty, then every nominee has a lane.
            
            
              Clicking a column heading will sort by that column. Click again
              will invert the sort.
            
            
              If the list is very long, then use the search box. It used
              wildcards, so you only a need snippet of the nominee's name. It
              reacts in real time to your key strokes. To see the full list
              again, clear the search box.
            
            
              The TimeToBeat, PersonalBest, AGE and Gender will give you useful
              information on whom to pick and where to place in the current
              selected heat.
            
            
              ðŸ‘‰ DOUBLE LMOUSE click on the chosen
              record to place the nominee into the lane.
            
            
              ðŸ‘‰ Or select nominee then click the
              Post button.
            
            
              ðŸ‘‰ To close the dialogue without making any changes, click the
              Cancel button.
            
            
              If the lane is filled with a swimmer prior to opening the
              Quick-Pick dialogue, then the swimmer get's 'bumped' out of the
              lane and is replaced with the selected nominee. The 'bumped'
              swimmer will be returned to the nominee's stack, awaiting a lane
              assignment.
            
            
              When the lane is empty, prior to opening the Quick-Pick, then that
              lane will be filled with the nominee you chose.
            
          
        
      
    

    
    Ellipse button. Method 2.
    
      This method differs in that you
      CNTRL-LMOUSE click the cell's
      Ellipse button to open the
      Quick Pick Member dialogue.
    

    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            
              This dialogue may appear very similar to method 1, but if you look
              closely you'll notice that the title is different. Also the list
              is likely to be significantly larger.
            
            
              The functionality of this dialogue is identical to the previous
              (method 1).
            
            
              This dialogue displays all active club members who do swim with
              one exception - Members who have been given a lane in the current
              selected event are excluded.
            
            The semantics is different...
            
              If you assign a member from this list to a lane then you have also
              nominated that member for the event. 'Two birds with one stone'.
              You created both a nominee and an entrant.
