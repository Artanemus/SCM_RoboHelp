  Navigating the heat table
  Selection for the heat table is ROW based.
  Arrow keys, UP, DOWN, LEFT and  RIGHT will move through each ROW. Else CLICK to selected.
  Note: the heat table doesn't have CELLs that you can edit.
  Heat Status
  This column can display either Open, Raced or Closed. By default a new heat is assigned Open. When all heats are Closed the event (in the Events Table) will display a check mark.
  
  A heat is considered Raced when the Marshall flags it's been completed. The Marshall application can do this remotely.
  A heat is considered Closed when all the race time data has been collected and entered. Typically this is the job of the events manager. Only the SwimClubMeet application can close heats.
  You'll note that there are no CELLs you can 'touch' and make changes. The heat table is always set to ROW select.
  When the heat status is raced, the Delete Heat button is disabled. You can still enter and make chages to race time. You can print reports.
  TODO: When the heat status is set to raced, disable changes to the Entrant's Name!
  When the heat staus is closed, the Delete Heat button is disabled. The entrant's table is dimmed. You can't make any changes in the entrant's table. You can print reports.
  Toggle Heat Status
  To toggle a Heats Status use the Toggle Status button.
  Or use the keyboard short-cut  ctrl-t.  Or right-mouse click to access the context sensitive pop-up menu and then select Toggle Status. 
  
    
      
        
          When all the heats for an event are closed then the event (in the event's table) will display a checkmark.
          The entrant table will appear grey when a heat is  closed. You can't modify the entrant's table when the heat is closed.
          Closed heats can't be modified or deleted.
          Entrant's in closed and raced heats are excluded from a auto-build events. 
          Report printing is a available regardless of the heat status.
          (When using a paperless setup, the Marshall will toggle the heat as raced. When the TimeKeepers have completed entered the all race times, the Event's Manager will close the heat. After closing the heat, no Marshall or TimeKeeper will have access to the heat. )
        
      
    
  
  Create New Heat
  To create a new heat click the New Heat button. Or either move to the last line and arrow down or move to the last field on the last line and press tab. 
  Or  right-mouse click to use the context sensitive popup menu and select New Heat.
  As new heats are inserted, they are automatically assigned an heat number.
  Another way to create new heats is to use the Auto-Build Heats button.
  Just fill with swimmers using the ellipse menu button.  See   Entrant's table for more details on building heats manually.
  The number of lanes created is determined by the Number Of Swimming Lanes preference, found in the options menu.
  Another way to create new heats is to use  Auto-Build Heats.
  Delete heat
   Click the Delete Heat button. Or select the heat and press CTRL-DELETE. Or  right-mouse click to use the context sensitive popup menu and select Delete Heat. A dialogue will be shown to confirm the deletion. There is no undo.  
  Heats that are closed or raced cannot be deleted.
  When a heat is deleted, the member's nomination data still remain. Entrant's that belonged to the deleted heat are sent back to the nominations cache where they await a lane. So manual entrant assignment and Auto-Create Heats all function as expected after heats have been deleted. 
  Delete the heat. You are asked to confirm if you wish to delete the heat. This button will be grayed (disabled) if the heat has been raced or closed.
  Currently there is no un-do for this action.
  Sort, change the heat order.
   To move a heat (change it's stack order) use the Move Heat buttons. Select the heat to move then press ARROW-UP or ARROW-DOWN buttons. The keyboard short-cuts are ctrl-up and ctrl-down. Sometimes it's not apparent that the heat have been moved. Checking the entrant data will affirm the heat has indeed been moved. 
  The heat numbers are automatically updated
  The keyboard short-cuts are ctrl-up and ctrl-down.
  Auto-build heats
  Pressing the settings icon found within the dialogue will expand it's window and display additional options.
  
  On running, all open heats are cleared.  Heats that are  closed or  raced remain in place. New heats created by 'auto-build' are appended to the end of the table and the table is renumbered. (wit: Your heats are re-ordered.)
    
    
    
    The number of heats created is dependant on the number of nominees. Nominees that are included in   closed or  raced don't take part in the auto-build.
  
   
  The 'TimeToBeat' determines which lane a nominee is given.
   
  For clarity, once a nominee is given a lane, then a nominee is officially an entrant.
   
  The fastest heat will be run last. If you seperate by gender, women's events will race first.
