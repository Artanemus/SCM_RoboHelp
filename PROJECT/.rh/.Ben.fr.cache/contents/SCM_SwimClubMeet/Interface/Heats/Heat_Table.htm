Navigating the heat table
  
Selection for the heat table is ROW based.
  
Arrow keys, 
UP, DOWN, LEFT and 
RIGHT will move through each ROW. Else 
CLICK to selected.
  
Note: the heat table doesn't have CELLs that you can edit.
  

Heat Status
  
This column can display either 
Open, Raced or 
Closed. 
By default a new heat is assigned 
Open. When all heats are 
Closed the event (in the Events Table) will display a check mark.
  


  
A heat is considered 
Raced when the Marshall flags it's been completed. The Marshall application can do this remotely.
  
A heat is considered 
Closed when all the 
race time data has been collected and entered. Typically this is the job of the events manager. Only the SwimClubMeet application can close heats.
  
You'll note that there are no CELLs you can 'touch' and make changes. The heat table is always set to ROW select.
  
When the heat status is 
raced, the 
Delete Heat button is disabled. You can still enter and make chages to race time. You can print reports.
  

TODO: When the heat status is set to raced, disable changes to the Entrant's Name!
  
When the heat staus is 
closed, the 
Delete Heat button is disabled. The entrant's table is dimmed. You can't make any changes in the entrant's table. You can print reports.
  

Toggle Heat Status
  

To toggle a Heats Status use the 
Toggle Status button.
  
Or use the keyboard short-cut 
ctrl-t.  Or 
right-mouse click to access the context sensitive pop-up menu and then select 
Toggle Status. 
  

Create New Heat
  

To create a new heat 
click the 
New Heat button. Or either move to the last line and 
arrow down or move to the last field on the last line and press 
tab. 
  
Or 
right-mouse click to use the context sensitive popup menu and select 
New Heat.
  

As new heats are inserted, they are automatically assigned an heat number.
  
Another way to create new heats is to use the 
Auto-Build Heats button.
  

Delete heat
  


Click the 
Delete Heat button. Or select the heat and press 
CTRL-DELETE. Or 
right-mouse click to use the context sensitive popup menu and select 
Delete Heat. A dialogue will be shown to confirm the deletion. There is no undo.  
  
Heats that are 
closed or 
raced cannot be deleted.
  
When a heat is deleted, the member's nomination data still remain. Entrant's that belonged to the deleted heat are sent back to the nominations cache where they await a lane. So manual entrant assignment and 
Auto-Create Heats all function as expected after heats have been deleted. 
  

Sort, change the heat order.
  


To move a heat (change it's stack order) use the 
Move Heat buttons. Select the heat to move then press 
ARROW-UP or 
ARROW-DOWN buttons. The keyboard short-cuts are 
ctrl-up and 
ctrl-down. Sometimes it's not apparent that the heat have been moved. Checking the entrant data will affirm the heat has indeed been moved.
