                Selection for the heat grid is ROW based. If any ROW is
                highlighted, then the grid has focus.
              
              
                Ensure the heat grid has focus, then use the arrow keys,
                UP, DOWN, LEFT and
                RIGHT  to move through each
                ROW. Or alternatively. use the mouse to selected a ROW. Note the
                column and record selector (the right bracket symbol) on the
                extreme left of the grid.. Clicking in this column will also
                select a ROW.
              
              
                The display of the lane grid will change as you browse the
                heats.

        If the session has been locked, heat grid, lane grid and buttons will be
        disabled (grayed). With the exception of the heats report button. With
        the session locked you can still print heat reports.
      
      
        The number of lanes shown is determined by the
        Number Of Swimming Lanes preference,
        found in the options menu.
      
      
        For clarity, once a nominee is given a lane, then that nominee is
        officially an entrant.

      Working with the heat status.
    
    
      The heat status column can display either
      Open, Raced or
      Closed.
    
    
      By default a new heat is assigned Open.
      
    
    
      
        ðŸ‘‰You can toggle the heat status by first selecting the
        heat and then use the short-cut key
        CNTRL+T.
      
      
        ðŸ‘‰Or RMouse click to
        access the pop-up menu and then select
        Toggle Heat Status.
      
      
        ðŸ‘‰Or click the
        Toggle Heat button to cycle through
        the states.
      
    
    
      When the heat status is raced, the
      Move Up,
      Move Down and
      Delete Heat buttons are disabled. All of
      the lane buttons will also be disabled. You can still enter and make
      changes to race time. You can print reports and create new heats.
    
    
      When the heat status is closed, the
      Move Up,
      Move Down and
      Delete Heat buttons and lane buttons
      remain disabled. The entrant's table is dimmed. You can't make any
      changes in the lane grid. You can print reports and create new heats.
    
    
      When running a paperless setup and after closing a heat, neither
      SCM_Marshal or
      SCM_Timekeeper applications can make changes
      to the heat.
    
    
      When ALL of the heats for an event are
      closed then the event (in the event's
      grid) will display a check-mark.
    
    
      Very Special Note: closed and
      raced heats are excluded from auto-build
      events.
    
    Â 
    
      Side note : Pool procedure
    
    
      If you are running in paperless mode, that is, your are using the support
      applications SCM_Marshal and
      SCM_TimeKeeper, it's good to instigate
      some pool procedure.
    
    
      A heat is considered raced when the
      Referee blows his whistle. The Chief Marshal or Referee can set the heat
      status using the SCM_Marshal application..
    
    
      A heat is considered closed when all the
      race time data has been entered into the database. Times can be entered by the Chief
      Timekeeper at the poolside by using the
      SCM_TimeKeeper application.
    
    
      Only the core application can close heats. After the Referee flags the
      heat is over the Chief Recorder does an Q&A and then closes the heat.

    Auto-build heats - summary ...
    
      
        ðŸ‘‰ The only way to run
        Auto-build heats is to click the
        button.

      On running, all open heats are cleared.
      Heats that are closed or
      raced remain in place. New heats created
      by Auto-build heats are appended to the
      end of the table and the table is renumbered. (wit: Your heats are
      re-ordered.)
      
      The number of heats created is dependant on the number of nominees.
      Nominees that are included in closed or
      raced are excluded from the auto-build.
    
    
      The fastest heat will be run last. If you seperate by gender, women's
