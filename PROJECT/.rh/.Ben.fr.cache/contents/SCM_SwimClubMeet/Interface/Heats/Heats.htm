Here are descriptions of the buttons found on the 
Heats TabSheet. 
  

Toggle Heat Status
  

Click this to toggle between 
open, 
raced and 
closed.
  
When all the heats for an event are 
closed then the event (in the event's table) will display a checkmark.
  
The entrant table will appear grey when a heat is 
closed. You can't modify the entrant's table when the heat is 
closed. 
Closed heats can't be modified or deleted (easily).
  
Entrant's in 
closed and 
raced heats are excluded from a auto-build events. 
  
Report printing is a availble regardless of the heat status.
  

(When using a paperless setup, the Marshall will toggle the heat as raced. When the TimeKeepers have completed entered the all race times, the Event's Manager will close the heat. After closing the heat, no Marshall or TimeKeeper will have access to the heat. )
  

New Heat
  

Yeh you guessed it.
  
When this button is pressed a new heat and all it's lanes are created. Just fill with swimmers using the ellipse menu button.  See  
Entrant's table for more details on building heats manually.
  
The number of lanes created is determined by the 
Number Of Swimming Lanes preference, found in the options menu.
  
Another way to create new heats is to use 
Auto-Build Heats.
  

Delete Heat
  

Delete the heat. You are asked to confirm if you wish to delete the heat. This button will be grayed (disabled) if the heat has been 
raced or 
closed.
  
Currently there is no un-do for this action.
  

Auto-Build Heats 
  

Click the 
AUTO-Build Heats button. The build heats dialogue appears. Pressing the settings icon found within the dialogue will expand it's window and display additional options.
  


  
On running, all 
open heats are cleared.  Heats that are 
closed or 
raced remain in place. New heats created by 'auto-build' are appended to the end of the table and the table is renumbered. (wit: Your heats are re-ordered.)

    

    The number of heats created is dependant on the number of nominees. Nominees that are included in  
closed or 
raced don't take part in the auto-build.
  
 
  
The 'TimeToBeat' determines which lane a nominee is given.
  
 
  
For clarity, once a nominee is given a lane, then a nominee is officially an entrant.
  
 
  
The fastest heat will be run last. If you seperate by gender, women's events will race first.
  
For more information on the auto-build's options, see 
Auto-Build Heats.
  
For more information on manually organizing entrants, see 
Entrant's table.
  
For more details on the TimeToBeat algorithm, see 
How it works.
  

Swap Entrant Lanes
  

Truely, the quickest way to swap lanes is to use the 
CTRL+UP and 
CRL+DOWN keys. But just so you have it all, there's a dedicated dialogue for the job.
  

(Moving entrants using the ctrl-arrows keys will shift an entrant not just in the current heat but across into other heats.)
  
How does it work? Enter the heat and lane info then click 
Swap Lanes to switch the entrants. This also work on empty lanes.

The keyboard short-cut is 
ctrl-x.

             
        
      
      

        

          
 
          

Clicking this
