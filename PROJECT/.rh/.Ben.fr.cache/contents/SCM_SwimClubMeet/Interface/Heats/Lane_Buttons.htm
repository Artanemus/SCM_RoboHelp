  Swap Entrant Lanes
  Truely, the quickest way to swap lanes is to use the CTRL+UP and CRL+DOWN keys. But just so you have it all, there's a dedicated dialogue for the job.
  (Moving entrants using the ctrl-arrows keys will shift an entrant not just in the current heat but across into other heats.)
  How does it work? Enter the heat and lane info then click Swap Lanes to switch the entrants. This also work on empty lanes.

          You have two choices.
          Clicking this  empty lane button.
           Displays this confirmation dialogue box. Answer Yes to remove the entrant from the lane.
          Most importantly, the nomination details still remains and you still have the option to re-enter them, if you so choose.
          The keyboard short-cut is ctrl-x.
            
             
          
        
      
      
        
           
          Clicking this  empty lane button.
          Displays something different. Answer Yes and the entrant is removed from the lane and their nomination is erased.
          Think of this senerio, someone doesn't show up or the swimmer descides, late in the session,this isn't the event for them. 
          The keyboard short-cut is ctrl-del.
