    Navigating the lane grid
    Selection in the lane grid is cell based.
    
      TAB and
      SHIFT+TAB are the most efficient way of
      moving around the grid. TAB and
      SHIFT+TAB key will only move to the cells
      that are editable. Those cells are RaceTime,
      scratched and
      disqualified. Pressing
      TAB  at the end of a line will move you down
      to the next lane. Pressing SHIFT+TAB  at the
      beginning of a line will move you up a lane.
    
    
      Arrow keys will navigate across all cells. Use
      UP, DOWN,
      LEFT and RIGHT .
      Left and right arrow keys don't navigate off the current lane.
    
    
    
      
        
          
          
        
        Info: These arrow keys are a little querky! You'll notice the left arrow
        can gets stuck inside time editboxes. They also effect how checkboxes
        are drawn. A developer's nightmare. Future releases will improve arrow
        key performance. üëç

      Moving entrants may be disabled, it depends on the status of the heat or
      session.
    
    
      It's possible to move an entrant into the previous or next heat just by
      using the short-cut keys or buttons.
    
    Note: You can hover over any of the buttons for a helpful hint.

    
    Grid Column - RaceTime.
    
      It's in this cell that you enter a swimmer's time for racing the event.
    
    
      Selecting the cell will automatically place it in edit mode with all its
      contents selected. Just start typing. If you want to use the edit cursor,
      then press ENTER or
      F2 or
      LMOUSE click the cell a second time and the
      cursor will appear.
    
    
      The RaceTime cell is special in that it uses a
      template or editmask. When the cursor is enabled and you are using the
      arrow keys to navigate you'll notice that the decimal period and colon
      characters are skipped over. Only numerical keys are accepted. Only
      minutes, seconds and milliseconds can be entered. Hours are not
      considered.
    
    
      Hold down SHIFT while using the arrow keys,
      will select a portion of the time for editing.
    
    DOUBLE LMOUSE click to select all.

      BACKSPACE .
    
    
      Press ESC to clear what's been entered and
      restore the previous known value. This doesn't exit you from edit mode.
    
    
      To exit edit mode, press
      ENTER, TAB, SHIFT-TAB, ARROW UP, ARROW DOWN.
      Or LMOUSE click outside the cell.
    

    
      Entering an invalid time, for example 01:62.20, will be ignored. You can't
      have 62 seconds! The race time will revert when you exit edit-mode -
      ignoring your erroneous entry. Note: you aren't prompted with an error
      message. Double check your race times.
    
    
      The SCM_Timekeeper application can set a
      swimmer's race time remotely.
    
    
      Most human timekeepers aren't the best at recording 1000ths. The reason
      SwimClubMeet accepts this precision is to prepare itself for electronic
      touch-pads. A future addition.

        start at the top. Check that the cell's contents is all selected...
      
      
        Enter the value, including leading zeros. Remember, only numerical (eg.
        If you want to enter 31 seconds and 41/100ths, do this, type 003141).
      
      Then arrow down. Rinse and repeat.

      the entrant to swim the event. Calculations are based on the members
      historical data using the algorithm selected in options.
    
    
      Auto-Build Heats uses TimeToBeat to build a list of swimmers, ordered
      fastest to lowest. Swimmers without a TTB will be placed in the slowest
      heat. If you would like to know more about how TTB works, then follow this
      link.
