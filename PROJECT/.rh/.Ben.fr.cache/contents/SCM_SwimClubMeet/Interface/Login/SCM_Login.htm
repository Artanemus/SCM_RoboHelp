    Login.

    
      Login to SwimClubMeet database server - MS
      SQLEXPRESS.
    

    
      
    

    
      On start-up, SwimClubMeet (or any ofthe other support applications) will
      display the login dialogue. This dialogue enables you to connection to
      Microsoft's SQLSERVER.
    

    
      It's here that you enter the server name. This can be a
      named path (or
      instance). As shown in the image.
    

    
      Another way the server name can be given is in the form of a IP address
      and optionally a port number. (eg. 127.0.0.1:1433). Typically an IP
      address is used if you are remotely accessing the database server. For
      example, when using the SCM_Nominate,
      SCM_Marshal and
      SCM_Timekeeper support applications. Remote
      access will require a user name and password.
    
    
      For OS Authentication to work, there are
      prerequisite. SQL Server Express comes with the default Windows
      Authentication mode when you first install it locally. With the Windows
      authentication mode, SQL Server validates a user by their Windows username
      and password. This means the password is not required once the user is
      logged into the Windows system.
    

    A valid connection is required else the application can't run.

    
      Pre-assigned remote user names.
    

    
      SCM SQL database has pre-assigned roles. They are SCM_Administrator,
      SCM_Marshal and SCM_Guest. Each role has limited access to tables and
      records.
    

    
      SCM_Administrator can read and write to all tables in the SCM database.
      (wit: a SCM superuser).
    

    
      SCM_Marshal can read all but can only write to event, entrant and
      nominate tables. SCM_Marshal can modify racetimes, entrant nominations,
      disqualify and scratch entrants.
    

    
      SCM_Guest can read specific tables, so as to see the night's events and
      swimmers times and placing. They also can view the leader-board.
    

    
      On install, a scmAdmin user and profile is created. It is a ssigned the
      SCM_Administrator role. The account hasn't been assigned a password and
      isn't activated. Use MSSMS to enable the account and set the password.
    

    
    
      
        
          
          
        
        Note: For security reasons, don't be tempted to use the SQLSERVER
        su
        account as quick short-cut to remote login. The SCM pre-defined user
        schemas give you much greater security.
