    Expand the events table.

            expanded, additional event fields are available.
          
        
      
    

    
      Note: on future versions of SCM, the event type field will be
        available. In this field you can select between individual and team
        events.
    

    
    Grid Column - Event Description.
    This column is only visible when the events grid is expanded.

    
      
    

    
      Descriptions placed in this column are displayed in dialogues, reports,
      and in the support application Nominate, Marshall, TimeKeeper, etc. They
      are displayed everywhere.
    

    Why the description column?

    
      Normally, event descriptions are not needed. But if you are running
      identical events, then this column is required. For example, you have
      2x50M Freestyle events. One for boys under 14 years and one for girls
      under 14 years. You'll need to describe these events, else caous.
    

    
      SCM can be told to place an auto description, each time you create a new
      event. The text used can be found in the
      Tools âž¡ Options âž¡ System âž¡ Event_Grid. You can
      modify this text.
    

    
      
        Note: on future versions of SCM, you'll be able to use meta-data to
        customize the descriptions based on the event type. (wit.
        auto-descriptions will be a little more useful.)
      
    

    
      When SCM creates finals, semi-finals and quarter-finals, it will write an
      auto-description. SCM adds these descriptions so the special events are
      delineated from the seed event.
    

    
    Grid column - Distance.
    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            SCM's default distances are 25m, 50m, 100m, 200m, 400m, 1000m.
            Distances are not arbitrary, they can be changed or added too in the
            SCM MSSQL database using SSMS.
