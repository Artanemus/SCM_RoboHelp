When creating finals, semi-finals and quater-finals, SCM will write an auto-description. SCM adds this description so the 'final' is delineated from the seed event. Auto descriptions can be edited..
  
Descriptions placed in this column are displayed in reports, the nominate, marshall and timekeeper apps and other dialogues. 
  
Why the description field? 
  

    

      

      

    
    

      

        


        
It's easy to seperate genders using the auto-build heats options.
      
      

        


        

          
But if you would like to see seperate boys and girls events clearly 
outlined in the meet's program.
          

Toggle expanded mode and enter a description.
          
 
        
      
      

        


        
Be aware, in the un-expanded view, these events will appear identical.

          

          
But in reports and other views these identical distance/stroke events will be clearly delineated.
      
    
  
  

The Marshal, Timekeeper and Nominate support apps also display these event descriptions.
