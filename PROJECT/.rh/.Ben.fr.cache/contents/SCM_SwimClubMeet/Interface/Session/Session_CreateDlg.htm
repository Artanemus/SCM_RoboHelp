              On opening the session dialogue, it's pre-filled with the current
              date and time. Calendar dates are localized to your region.
            

            
              The session description can be up to 256 characters long, but it's
              best to keep it brief. It's purpose is to make the session
              memorable. Perhaps a note on the weather? This description doesn't
              appear in session reports, just in the grid. Session descriptions
              are optional.

              The position of a new session in the table is determined by it's
              date. The most recent session is placed at the top of the grid.
            
            
              If the session grid requires a re-sort, press the Refresh button.
