    Create a new session.

    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            There are many ways to create a new session...

            
              
                ðŸ‘‰ LMOUSE click the
                New Session button. The new session
                dialogue opens.
              
              
                ðŸ‘‰ or hover over the session grid and
                RMOUSE click. The context sensitive
                popup menu will appear. Select
                New Session. The new session
                dialogue opens.
              
              
                ðŸ‘‰ or press CNTRL-INS. The new
                session dialogue opens.
              
              
                ðŸ‘‰ or move to the last line and
                ARROW DOWN. A new session record
                appears in the grid, ready for you to edit.
              
              
                ðŸ‘‰ or move to the last cell on the last line and press
                TAB. A new session record appears
                in the grid, ready for you to edit.
              
              
                It's recommended that the last two methods are avoided. Using
                the new session dialogue makes entering date and time a little
                easier and illegal dates are averted. You may also need to
                re-sort the grid if you use the in-line editor. If a re-sort is
                needed then click the
                Refresh button.
              
              
                As new sessions are added they are sorted based on date. The
                most recent sessions are placed at the top.
              
            
          
        
      
    

    
    Session Pop-up Menu.
    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            Hover over the session grid, then
            RMOUSE click to open the context
            sensitive pop-up menu.
          
        
      
    

    
    New Session Dialogue

    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            The New Session dialogue box. It contains a calendar and time
            widget. This makes editing session times a little easier to enter.
            Use this method over editing directly into the session grid.

    Editing within the grid.
    
      If you are not using the session dialogue (recommended) and are instead
      editing directly into the grid, here are some helpful tips.
    

    
      Use the mouse, arrow or tab keys to navigate cells. To enter edit mode...
    
    
      
        ðŸ‘‰ Have focus on the cell and then press
        F2 or ENTER.
      
      
        ðŸ‘‰ LMOUSE the cell to focus on cell, then
        LMOUSE again.
      
    
    
      In edit mode you will notice that the cell uses an editmask. This ensures
      the date and time are correctly formatted. Also the time section uses 24
      hour notation.
    
    
      To exit edit mode, press
      ENTER, TAB, SHIFT-TAB, ARROW or
      LMOUSE click outside the cell.
    
    
      Please note, currently the windows cursor is not tracking correctly in
      this grid, it will be fixed in future releases.
    

    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            On exiting edit-mode, if the date or time is illegal, then the error
            dialogue appears.

            
              After closing the dialogue, your erroneous data entry is ignored
              and the cell reverts.
            
          
        
      
    

    
    Delete a session
    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            Remember that when you delete a session, all nominations, entrants,
            heats and events are removed. If you have recorded race times, then
            that data will be lost. You are given warnings when you attempt a
            delete. To delete a session...
            
              
                ðŸ‘‰ Click the
                Delete the current selected session
                button.
              
              
                ðŸ‘‰ or hover over the session grid and
                RMOUSE click to use the pop-up
                menu. Select Delete Session....
              
              
                ðŸ‘‰ or select a session and then use the keyboard short-cut
                CTRL-DEL.
              
            
          
        
      
      
        
          
        
        
          
            
              
              In all instances a confirm dialogue appears. There is no undo.
              
                You can't delete a locked session. When locked the delete button
                is grayed.
              
            
          
        
      
    

    
    Lock a Session.
    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            Tomato red indicates that a session is locked. Typically, you would
            lock a session after all the events have been raced.
            
              A locked session disables data entry for events, nominations and
              heats. These grids will appear grayed to indicate they are
              read-only. Most buttons for these grids are also grayed. However,
              you can still navigate events and print reports. Locking a session
              protects your data from accidental entry.
            
            To lock, un-lock a session ...
            
              
                ðŸ‘‰ Click the lock/unlock button.
              
              
                ðŸ‘‰ or hover over the session grid and
                RMOUSE click to use the pop-up
                menu. Select the menu item,
                lock/unlock.
              
              
                ðŸ‘‰ or select a session and then use the keyboard short-cut
                CTRL-L.
              
            
          
        
      
    

    
    
      Toggle Session Visibility.
    
    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            To toggle the visibility of
            closed sessions..
            
              
                ðŸ‘‰ click the
                Toggle Visibility button.
              
            
            
              If the visibility button is enabled then all closed sessions will
              be hidden. The button will change appearance when sessions are
              made invisible. The state of visibility isn't remembered on close
              of the application.
            
          
        
      
    

    
    Re-Sort Session.
    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            To re-sort the session table...
          
        
      
    

    
      ðŸ‘‰ click the Refresh button.
      
        ðŸ‘‰ or hover over the session grid and
        RMOUSE click. The pop-up menu will appear,
        select Refresh.
      
    

    The most recent session will be placed at the top of the table.
    
      The only time you would need to re-sort is after you have created a new
      session by editing within the grid.
    

    
    Clone Session.
    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            The current selected session is uses to build a duplicate. The clone
            is given today's date. It's assigned a description with the metadata
            CLONE OF: Club Night #DATETIME#.
            
              Only the events of the original are copied into the clone.
              (Nomination, Heats, Entrants and Race-Times are ignored).
            
            To clone a session ...
            
              
                ðŸ‘‰ Goto the Menu Bar and follow

                ðŸ‘‰ or hover over the session grid and
                RMOUSE click. The pop-up menu will
                appear, select Clone Session....
              
            
          
        
      
    

    
    View the Session Report.
    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            To see a session report...
          
        
      
    

    
      
        ðŸ‘‰ Click the

        CNTRL+LMOUSE click will display the
        alternative version of the session report.
      
      
        ðŸ‘‰ Or hover over the session grid and
        RMOUSE click. The popUp menu will appear,
        select Session Report*. As above,
        CNTRL+LMOUSE on the menu item was produce
        the alternative version of the report.
      
    
    
      The first page on each report gives the session date. All pages are
      numbered and displayed in the footer. Each report displays race time (if
      they have been entered), Personal Best (the entrant's fastest swimming
      time - prior to this session) and DIFF. The DIFF or difference value is a
      negative or positive and shows the performance improvement, or not, for
      the event. A negative amount is what every swimmer wants to see.
