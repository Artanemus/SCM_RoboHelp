    Backup Your Data.
    
      It important to schedule a regular backup of your data. You may very well
      keep years of historical data and it would be tragic to lose it.
    
    
      Backup and restore of the
      SCM database is done with
      Microsoft's

      SQLEXPRESS
      database server.

      by pressing its + symbol

      RMOUSE click to show the context
      sensitive pop-up menu
    
    
      Select the menu item Tasks, then select
      Back Up ...

            This may change in future releases. A backup option may be included
            in the menubar under the file menu.
