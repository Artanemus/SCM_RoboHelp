  Your first club night with SCM.
  Here's a step-by-step outline of what's needed to get started. 
  
    You need swimmers. Use the Club Members button and add your members.
      
      Get yourself comfortable, this is going to take some time. Good news - you only do this once. Minimum requirements are FirstName, LastName, DOB and Gender.
      
       
    
    Add a new "Session" in the "Session Table". With that session selected ...
        
        TIP: A short note makes the session memorable. eg.'Clear skies and bar-b-que'.
      
       
    
    Add your events into the "Events Table" by entering "Distance" and "Stroke". 
      
      If you need to describe your events. Click the Expander button to expand the event grid. The 'description' column is now visible. Any text entered here will be seen by everyone and displayed in every report.
      
       
    
    Select the next tab-sheet - Nominate. Here you select the swimmer then check the events they will be swimming.
      
      If you need to know if they are 'Qualified' to swim the event. Toggle the 'Qualified' button on.
      
       
    
    Select the next tab-sheet - Heats. Press the Build Heats button for each event. Be aware, your database, at this stage, is totally empty. So your swimmers will not be 'matched-up' correctly. (See the special note below.) 
      
      TIP: There's a 'build all heats' in the menu bar.
      
       
    
    You are ready to print the marshal and time-keepers' forms.
      
      TIP: If the 'print-set' button isn't enough, there's a 'print all marshal and timekeeper forms' in the menu bar. But beware, the windows print spooler is probably turned on and that's a lot of printer jobs! 
      
       
    
    When a heat has been swum - enter the swimmers' times into the "race time'' column.
      
      Use the arrow-down or tab-key to move to the next race time.
      
       
    
    When the session is completed, print the session report to PDF and email.
      
      TIP: Check-out the 'qualified swimmers report' in tools >> qualification times... >> reports. 
    
  
  That it.
   
  
    
     
       
            
            
           Here's a link to a short YouTube Video that takes you through the above process in detail.

  Special note:
      If you want to 'kick-start' your TimeToBeat algorithm (you have just installed the application and you have no race data) add a new session that is dated prior to the new swimming season. Populate that session with every type of event imagineable. Then fill selected events with your member's personal best race-times. That way when the very first SCM club night is played ... entrants are correctly placed. This also a useful technique to introduce new members into your club, that join late in the season.
