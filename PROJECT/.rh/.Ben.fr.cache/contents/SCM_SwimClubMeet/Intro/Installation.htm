  INSTALLATION IN DETAIL
  
    Install Microsoft SQL Server Express
      
      There's heaps of videos and help files on the internet that will show you how to install MS SQLEXPRESS. Typing 'ms sql express download'  into Google search generally gets you the correct page.
      
      It's recommend that you make a note of your server registered name (or instance) once the installation is complete .
    
    Install Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) (optional)
      
      It's been noted that the latest SQLEXPRESS installation will offer you the option to include SSMS with it's install. 
      
      It's a handy tool for diagnostics (experience needed - expert) and can be used to backup your SCM database (experience needed - computer noob). 
       
    
    Run the SCM_BuildMeAClub installation file. This will install the BuildMeAClub app and SQL scripts needed to build the SwimClubMeet database on the SQLEXPRESS database server. After the installation is completed, run it.
      
      TIP: type 'buildme' in the Windows search bar to quickly find the application.
    
    Run the SwimClubMeet installer. This will install SwimClubMeet.
  
  For the next basic steps go to your first club night with SCM.
