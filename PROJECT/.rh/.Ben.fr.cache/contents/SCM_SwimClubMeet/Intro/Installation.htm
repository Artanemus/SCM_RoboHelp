    INSTALLATION - IN DETAIL
    
      
        Install Microsoft SQL Server Express
        
          There's heaps of videos and help files on the internet that will show
          you how to install MS SQLEXPRESS. Typing
          ms sql express download
          into the Google search bar generally gets you to the download page.
        
        
          It's recommended that you make a note of your server registered name
          once the installation is completed.
        
      
      
        Install Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
        
          It's a handy tool for diagnostics (experience needed - expert) and can
          be used to backup your SCM database (experience needed - computer
          noob).
        
      
      
        Run the SCM_BuildMeAClub installation utility.
        
          This will install the
          BuildMeAClub application and SQL scripts
          needed to build the SwimClubMeet database on the SQLEXPRESS database
          server. After the installation is completed, run
          BuildMeAClub.
        
      
      
        Run the SCM_SwimClubMeet installation utility.
        
          This will install the core application
          SwimClubMeet. By default the SCM icon
          will appear on your PC's desktop.
        
      
    
    
      
      
        
        
        
          
            
              
              
            
            It's been noted that the latest SQLEXPRESS installation will give
              you the option to include SSMS with the install.
          
        
        
        
      
    
    
      
      
        
        
        
          
                
              
              TIP: By default there isn't a desktop icon for BMAC. So after
                it's installation, type 'buildme' in the Windows search bar to
                quickly find the application.
