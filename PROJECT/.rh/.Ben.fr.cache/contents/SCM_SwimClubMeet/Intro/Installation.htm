  INSTALLATION IN DETAIL
  
    Install Microsoft SQL Server Express
      
      There's heaps of videos and help files on the internet that will show you how to install MS SQLEXPRESS. Typing 'ms sql express download'  into the Google search bar generally gets you to the download page.
      
      It's recommended that you make a note of your server registered name once the installation is completed.
    
    Install Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 
      
      It's a handy tool for diagnostics (experience needed - expert) and can be used to backup your SCM database (experience needed - computer noob). 
    
    Run the SCM_BuildMeAClub installation utility. This will install the BuildMeAClub application and SQL scripts needed to build the SwimClubMeet database on the SQLEXPRESS database server. After the installation is completed, run BuildMeAClub.exe.
    Run the SwimClubMeet installation utility. This will install the core application SwimClubMeet.exe. By default the SCM icon will appear on your PC's desktop.
  
  
    
     
       
            
            
           It's been noted that the latest SQLEXPRESS installation will give you the option to include SSMS with it's install. 
       
    
  
  
    
     
      
              
             TIP: By default there isn't a desktop icon for BMAC. So after it's installation, type 'buildme' in the Windows search bar to quickly find the application.
       
    
  
  For the next basic steps go to your first club night with SCM.
