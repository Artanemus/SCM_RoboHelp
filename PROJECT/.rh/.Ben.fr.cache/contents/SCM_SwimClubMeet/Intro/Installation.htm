  INSTALLATION IN DETAIL
  
    Install Microsoft SQL Server Express
      
      There's heaps of videos and help files on the internet that will show you how to install MS SQLEXPRESS. Typing 'ms sql express download'  into Google search generally gets you to the download page.
      
      It's recommend that you make a note of your server registered name (or instance) once the installation is completed.
    
    Install Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) (optional)
      
      It's a handy tool for diagnostics (experience needed - expert) and can be used to backup your SCM database (experience needed - computer noob). 
      
        
         
           
                
                
               It's been noted that the latest SQLEXPRESS installation will offer you the option to include SSMS with it's install. 
           
        
      
    
    Run the SCM_BuildMeAClub installation file. This will install the BuildMeAClub app and SQL scripts needed to build the SwimClubMeet database on the SQLEXPRESS database server. After the installation is completed, run BuildMeAClub.
      
        
         
          
                  
                 TIP: after installation, type 'buildme' in the Windows search bar to quickly find the application quickly.
           
        
      
    
    Run the SwimClubMeet installer. This will install SwimClubMeet. By default the SCM icon will appear on your PC's desktop.
    
  
  For the next basic steps go to your first club night with SCM.
