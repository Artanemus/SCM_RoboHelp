  Why is SCM best suited toÂ local swimming clubs?
  Your local swimming club differs from a large competitiveÂ event in many ways.
  Typically a local swim club look like this ...
  Nominations for events happens at the pool gate. Parents are keenÂ to get the event's started so they can get the kids home and to bed, but the night start's slowly, there's a cue toÂ nominate.
  Most club's have small membership numbers, say 50-80 swimmers, so it's normal to mixÂ gender and agesÂ into individual heats. Â Â 
  Parents are given the jobs of timekeeperÂ orÂ marshal. And someone is sitting in a corner, with a laptop,Â setting the meet up, probably into a spread sheet. There's lots of paper being couriered around the pool.
  What's needed ...
  Quickly get members nominated.
    A simple way to nominate.
    A single button to build heats.
    Remove printer ink and paper.
    Collect timekeeper's race-times easily.
    Store and archive some basic member's details.Â (name,Â age,Â gender and swimmingÂ history.)
    Tabulate a reportÂ of the night's sessionÂ .
  SCM's charter.
  SCMÂ is focused on 'what isÂ needed' and most importantly, keep it simple.Â 
  Just getting started .... (I have just a lap-top and printer)
  SwimClubMeet is the core app - it does it all. It creates sessions and events, nominateÂ andÂ Auto-Builds all your heats,Â enterÂ race-times. It also manages members details. It does reporting.Â Â 
  It'll print-out all the forms you need. Such as the Marshall's rally sheet and Timekeeper's entry sheet. At the end of the night you can create a session report for distribution to parent and friends.
  If you have the resources ... Wi-Fi, more than one computer (touch screen?)Â 
  Got two computers and a hub or wi-fi. Connect the two, share the SQL server and run SwimClubMeet on both. Nominate swimmers twice as fast.
  Go one step further ...
  Then there's the support applications.
  
    
      
      
    
    
      
        
          SCM gives you a simple kiosk type app for members to self-nominate at the entry gate.Â (Designed for MS Surface PRO)
          You may wish to use the Marshall and Timekeeper apps for a paperless club night. (Designed for MS Surface PRO).
        
      
    
  
  Currently in development
  A stand-alone app just to manage membership data, should you wish to delegate tasks.
  A leader-board app to track swimmer and house scores, in real time. (for you club's end-of-season finals)
  Future ideas and plans
  A SCM_StatsÂ package.Â Lots of charts and stats, for the annual committee meeting.
    A SCM_CarnivalÂ application to make it easy for neighboring clubs to challenge each other to a 'swim-off'.
    A SCM_ReportÂ package for some additional forms, for example, bar-coded membership cards, accreditation and podium certificates, etc.
    A SCM_PreNominate appÂ that uses email and PDF data-forms.Â Fully automated. (Avoids using web services, keeps it simple).
    
    All developement of SCM is being done on a cross-platform compiler. This means that Android and iOS versions of nominate, marshalÂ and timekeeper application will eventually be delivered.
