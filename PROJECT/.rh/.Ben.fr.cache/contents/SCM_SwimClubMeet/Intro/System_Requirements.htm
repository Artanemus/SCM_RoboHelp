  System Specifications.
  SwimClubMeet (the core application) has been designed and tested on WINDOWS 10 running Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS 2017 or higher. Your system should have a least 4.00 GB installed memory (RAM) and a least 1GB of storage. 
  It's been noted that SwimClubMeet will run on WINDOWS 7 and SQLEXPRESS 2014, 2016, (but isn't not supported by this developer).
  All SCM applications are very kind on CPU resources. And you don't need a high end graphics card.
  Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS is a little bit more hungry. But everything has been optimized. Even with an level entry laptop and multiply connections, the performance experienced is extremely good.
  (Based on 4 years of beta testing with local swimming clubs in my area - Ben Ambrose, application developer.)
