  System Specifications.
  SwimClubMeet (the core application) has been designed and tested on WINDOWS 10 running Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS 2017 or higher. Your system should have a least 4.00 GB installed memory (RAM) and a least 1GBÂ of storage.Â 
  It's been noted that SwimClubMeet will run on WINDOWS 7 and SQLEXPRESS 2014, 2016, (butÂ isn't not supported by this developer).
  All SCM applications are very kind on CPU resources. And you don't need a high end graphics card.
  Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS is a little bit more hungry. But everything has been optimized. Even with an level entry laptop and multiply connections, the performance experienced is extremely good.
  Next step InstallationÂ of the software.
