              There is an advance setting that lets you display IDs in the

              Menubar and follow the bread crumbs
              Tools â†’ Options â†’ Other. Then enable
              the setting ðŸ—¹ show debug information.
              For the member's ID field to be populated you need to be
              positioned on a swimming lane that has an entrant assigned.
