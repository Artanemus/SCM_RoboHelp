                      Method 1Â : CNTRL-Mouse ClickÂ GotoÂ MemberÂ to quickly jump to the member's membership#. Enter a membership# into the editbox. If a member doesn't have a membership#Â then a message appears saying it doesn't exsist.
                      If a valid number is entered, Click Goto.Â 
                      Â 
                    
                  
                  
                    
                      Method 2: Mouse Click GotoÂ MemberÂ to locate a member's ID.
                      An ID is a unique identification number that is automatically created by SQLEXPRESS when a new member is created. Normally this number isn't visible. It does however appear in the Member's Details tabsheet. It's the first parameter that appears at the very top of the tab-sheet.Â 
                      It can also be displayed in the header bar if ðŸ—¹ show debug information is enabled (To locate this option goto the menu bar and follow the bread crumbs tools â†’ optionsÂ â†’ other). For the member's ID field to be populated you need to be positioned on a swimming lane that has an entrant assigned.
                    
                  
                
              
            
            Close
