    Score Reports (Collection).

    
    SOME IMPORTANT NOTES.
    The score reports produced by the core application are for diagnostics.
    
      If you desire a simple, clean, user friendly report on the current
      session, then use the Score LeaderBoad output. Goto the menubar and
      follow the bread crumbs...
      Tools ➡ Score... ➡ LeaderBoard and press the
      Update button. Ensure it's formatted
      correctly before moving to the next tab,
      Reports, and press the
      LeaderBoard button.
    
    
      The format produced is reliant on the score setup. Remember, to produce a fully finalised score report, all heats must have been swum and closed.
    
    
      The SCM_LeaderBoard application offer a much
      simpler path to score report production.
    

    
    
      
        
          Divisions and Members .
        
      
    
    
      
        List all the members of each division.
      
      
        Members only need to be active to be in this list. If your divisions
        includes subsets, then some members may appear more than once in this
        list. Please note that the title header displays how the age of each
        member is calculated. (Prepared at 75% scale.)
      
    
    
      
        
      
    

    
    
      
        
          Entrant Scores for Session.
        
        
      
    
    
      
        This is the breakdown of the scores for the current selected session. It
        displays place and points for both ABSOLUTE position and RELATIVE to
        division - grouped by division, then by entrant. This detailed report
        includes aggregates for each member. This report is for diagnostics. For
        a much cleaner presentation - use the SCM_LeaderBoard application. Note
        that the title header displays how the age was calculated and what
        session it was derived from. This report can take time to build. Be
        patient. (Prepared at 75% scale.)
      
    

    
      
        
      
    

    
    
      
        
          Entrant Scores for Events.
        
        
      
    
    
      
        This report is simular to the above, but it is group by event. This
        report is for diagnostics. Note that the title header displays how the
        age was calculated and what session it was derived from. For user
        friendly report scoring it's recommended that you use the
        SCM_LeaderBoard application. (Prepared at 75% scale.)
