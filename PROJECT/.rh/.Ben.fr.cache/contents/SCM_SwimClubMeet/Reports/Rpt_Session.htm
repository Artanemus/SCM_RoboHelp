    Session Reports x 2.
    
      
        The first page on each report gives the session date. All pages are
        numbered and displayed in the footer. Each report displays race time (if
        they have been entered), Personal Best (the entrant's fastest swimming
        time - prior to this session) and DIFF. The DIFF or difference value is
        a negative or positive and shows the performance improvement, or not,
        for the event. A negative amount is what every swimmer wants to see.
