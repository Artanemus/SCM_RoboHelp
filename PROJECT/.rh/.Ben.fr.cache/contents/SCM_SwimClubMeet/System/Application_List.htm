    Standalone Applications not bundled with SCM

    
      The following applications have been written in a cross platform compiler.
      It's intended that in future releases there will be Linux, Mac, iPhone,
      Android and iPad variants of these applications. When you share your
      database server over wi-fi, these remote applications collectively perform
      most of the functions that the core application can do.
    

    SCM_Nominate.exe
    
      Beta. This is a stand alone application. This application allows members
      to quickly nominate for the 'nights' events. It's like a kiosk - swimmers
      enter their membership number and then nominate for the listed events. Set
      up a couple of tablets at the front gate for quick event nomination.
    

    SCM_Marshal.exe
    
      This is a stand alone application. This application lets your lane
      marshall to browse events and heats. Displays entrants, their lane numbers
      and race time (once they have been entered by Admin or Timekeeper) . The
      marshall can also flag a heat as 'raced'.
    

    SCM_Timekeeper.exe
    
      This application lets your timekeepers track events, heats for their
      assigned lane. It shows the entrant name, timetobeat and personal best for
      the assign lane. The timekeeper may enter the race time for the entrant
      which is then sent to the server. Or set the roaming feature on. This
      enabled one Grand Timekeeper Official to collect each lane's time for each
      heat run. SCM_LeaderBoard, Beta. This is a windows 10 only, stand alone
      application. It uses a local SQLiteV3 to optimize performance and remove
      the load off the core MSSQL Server. This application allows you to track
      member, house and event scores, in real time. It includes a report system.
      Use this application to track scores for your end-of-season finals. May
