        to the SwimClubMeet database.
      
    
    Outline - Step-by-Step
    
      For the computer running the MS SQLEXPRESS database server, the following
      must be done.
    

    
    
      üëâ 1. Enable TCP/IP for the database server.
      üëâ 2. Set a static port number for database server.
      üëâ 3. Enable remote logins for the database server.
      üëâ 4. Setup a database login.
      üëâ 5. Set the PC's firewall to allows communications on the port.
      üëâ 6. Test the connection.
    

    
      
        Changing settings will require a restart of the database server, else
        the changes are ignored.
      
    

    On the computer(s) that will be connecting ...
    
      Prepare PC firewall to allow communications on the assigned port.
      
        Remote logins must use IP address and port to connect to the database
        server.
      
      Remote logins must use database server accounts. ie. scmAdmin.
    

    Router, Wi-Fi considerations ...
    
      Ensure port forwarding is enabled for the assigned port.
      
        Assign a static or lease a port forever for the router connection that
        has the database server.
      
    

    Detailed step-by-step guide ...

    
      
        This guide assumes you have Windows 10 and are running SQLEXPRESS
          2017 or 2019.
        
      
      
        In this example I'm using the
        SQL Server Configuration Manager. You can
        also access these settings with the
        Computer Management panel. You will have
        to drill down into the tree to find the service. A database restart can
        also be done from this panel.
      
    

    

    
      1. Enable TCP for the database server.
    
    
      Run the
      SQL Server Configuration Manager
      application. This application is installed with Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS. To
      locate this application use the windows start button and navigate to
      Microsoft SQL Server folder.
    
    
      If you are having problems finding it then type 'SQL Server' in the
      windows search box (found on the task bar).
    

    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            

            
              The image shown here is TCP/IP for Protocols for SQLEXPRESS - in
              the process of being enabled.
            
            
              
                
                  Ensure Protocols for SQLEXPRESS is
                  selected.
                
                
                  Then select TCP/IP.
                
                
                  RMOUSE click and select
                  Enabled from the popup menu.
                
              
            
          
        
      
    

    
      2. Set a static port number for the database server.
    
    
      
        
      
      
        
        
          
            
            Next we have to set the port that the database uses in communicating
            with a connection.
            
              This image shows how to access the properties of the TCP/IP
              protocol.
            

            
              
                
                  Protocols for SQLEXPRESS is
                  selected.
                
                
                  Then select TCP/IP.
                
                
                  RMOUSE click and select
                  Properties from the popup menu.
                
              
            
          
        
      
    

    
    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            This image displays the properties dialogue. The protocol tab-sheet
            is selected.
            üëâüèª Ensure Enable is assigned Yes
            üëâüèª Ensure Listen All is assigned Yes
            
              Please note, this port configuration is fairly lose in security.
              Once you have everything connected and tested, you might review
              your port assignments.
            
            üëâüèª Select the next tab-sheet, IP Address.
          
        
      
    

    
    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            This image displays the IP Addresses. At the bottom of the list is
            IPALL.
            
              üëâüèª Ensure TCP Dynamic Ports is blank.
            
            
              üëâüèª Assign 1433 into
              TCP Port. This is SQLEXPRESS default
              port.
            
            
              üëâüèª Press OK, to save your changes.
            
          
        
      
    

    Restart the database server.
    
    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            For these changes to be assigned, a restart is required.
            This image shows the database server being restarted.
            
              
                First select SQL Server Services.
                Then select SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS).
                
                  RMOUSE click and select
                  Restart from the popup menu.
                
              
            
          
        
      
    

    
      3. Enable remote logins for the database server..
    

    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            
              Next step is to get the database server to accept remote logins.
              Close up any apps and lets move on.
            
            Run Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio application.
            
              After successfully logging in, the next step is to select the
              server name (top line).
            
            
              Then RMOUSE click and select
              Properties from the popup menu.
            
          
        
        
          
            
            With the Server Properties dialogue open...

            
            
              
                Select the Security tab.
              
              
                Then enable the radiobutton
                SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode.
              
              Press OK.
            
            
            
              Doing this will enable remote logins using the server's user
              accounts. This change won't come into effect until you have
              restarted the server.
            
          
        
      
    

    Restart the SQLEXPRESS server.
    
      Select the server name (top line). Right mouse, but this time select
      'Restart' from the popup menu.
    

    
    4. Setup a database login.

    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            
              The next task is to create a login. Then assign permissions so
              that login can work in the SwimClubMeet database
            
            
              SCM_BuildMeAClub has created some useful Roles and Schemas within
              the SwimClubMeet database. These can be used to setup your remote
              logins.
            
            
              
                        
          
        
      
    


    Ensure the following are checked for schema SCM_Administrator
    
      db_datareader
      db_datawriter
    

    Ensure the new login is enabled.
    Close down MSSMS.

    
    
      5. Set the firewall to allows communications on the port. (UDP, TCP)
    
    
      If you are running a virus protection application, then SQLEXPRESS is
      fire-walled. It cannot send data across the assigned port. You must
      configure your virus protection application to port forward the assigned
      port. In both directions, and for both protocols, TCP and UDP.
    
    
      As every virus protection package is different, it's not possible to do a
      step-by-step of the configuration procedure. For testing, you might
      consider disabling your firewall. Then re-enable once the router, remote
      PCs and database server are all talking.
    

    
    6. Test the connection.
    Disable your firewall.
    Does the login work locally? Lets test that out.
    Close all apps. DO A REBOOT, ENSURE EVERYTHING IS INITIALIZED.
    Run SwimClubMeet and try this login...
    localhost\SQLEXPRESS login:scmAdmin password:####
    
      Did it work? Can you edit, delete, move stuff about? If it's worked - then
      your scmAdmin user is up and running.
    
    
      Now we'll attempt to use the Loop-Back feature to test an IP connection.
      Disconnect from Wi-Fi. Remove ethernet cable, etc. (Restart PC?) Then try
      this...
    
    IP address of db server - 127.0.0.1,1433 login:scmAdmin password:####
    
      Note the comma after the IP address, then the static port number 1433. Did
      it work? This isn't a solid test for IP connectivity - but it's a good
      indicator all is well.
    

    Router Configuration..
    Important notes: 
    
      Wi-Fi routers will need 'Port Forwarding' enabled for the assigned port,
      in both direction, for protocols TCP and UDP.
    
    
      Your router acts as DNS and assigns IP addresses to each connection. Most
      routers have a setting to 'lease' a fixed IP address to the same computer
      on connection. The 'lease time' can be hours or 'forever'. Consider
      setting the lease time for computer with the MS SQL server to 'forever'.
      That way the login IP address will always be same.
    
    
      As each router is different, sorry no help session, instead refer to your
      router's manual..
