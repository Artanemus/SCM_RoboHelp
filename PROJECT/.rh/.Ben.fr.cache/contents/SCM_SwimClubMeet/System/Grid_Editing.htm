      Edit-Mode for you to modify the cell.

          When using the mouse: first select the CELL by
          LMOUSE click. Then
          LMOUSE click again to enter
          Edit-Mode.
        
        
          If you are using the keyboard: navigate to the cell by using
          TAB or
          ARROW keys. Then use
          F2 or press
          ENTER to enter
          Edit-Mode.

    EDITING TRICKS and SHORT-CUTS
    
      By default: when you first enter
      Edit-Mode the Cell will auto-matically have
      all it's contents selected. Just click anywhere in the cell to deselect
      all. Arrow keys also work.
    
    
      Holding down SHIFT while using the arrow
      keys, will select a portion of the time for editing.
    

    DOUBLE LMOUSE click to select all.

    
      BACKSPACE in most instances deletes all the
      content within the CELL.
    
    
      Press ESC to clear what's been entered and
      restore the previous known value. This doesn't exit you from edit mode.
    

    
      Some CELLs use templates or editmasks. One example of this is the
      RaceTime CELL. When the cursor is enabled and
      you are using the arrow keys to navigate you'll notice that the decimal
      period and colon characters are skipped over.
    

    EXIT EDIT-MODE
    
      You have two ways in which to exit
      Edit-Mode and commit your changes.
    

    
    
      
        
          When using mouse: LMOUSE click outside
          the cell.
        
        
          If you are using keyboard:
          ENTER, TAB, SHIFT-TAB, ARROW UP, ARROW DOWN.
