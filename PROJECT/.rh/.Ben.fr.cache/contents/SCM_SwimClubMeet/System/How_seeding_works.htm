    SCM How seeding works

    Seeding Arrangements
    
      Depending on the meet, the first heat can contain the fastest swimmers or
      the slowest swimmers. Dual meets are often organized in fastest to slowest
      seeding. It simplifies the organization of the meets and requires less
      preparation work than other types of seeding.
    
    
      Bigger meets usually place the fastest swimmers in the last heats, there
      are a few different ways they can be organized.
    
    
       tips_and_updates SCM uses the latter - fastest in the last heat.
    

    Regular Seeding
    
      When the meet has timed finals, the events are usually organized with
      regular seeding. Since swimmers only get one shot at swimming that
      particular event, they're matched with competitors of most similar speed.
      This means that the fastest swimmers are placed together in the last
      heats.
    
    
      The fastest swimmers in a heat always swim in the middle lanes. The slower
      swimmers in a heat are placed in the outside lanes. This allows swimmers
      to compete against those closest to their speed.
    

    
       tips_and_updates SCM uses regular seeding as the default.
    

    Circle Seeding
    
      When a meet has preliminary heats and finals, the events often have circle
      seeding. In an eight-lane pool, the 24 fastest swimmers are placed in the
      last three heats. Regular seeding is still used for earlier heats.
    
    
      In each of the three heats, the fastest swimmers are in the middle lanes.
      In the last heat, the top seeded individual is placed in the middle lane:
      Lane four. In the second to last heat, the second seeded swimmer is also
      placed in lane four. The third seed is in the third fastest heat in the
      middle lane as well. Then the pattern wraps around and repeats. The fourth
      place swimmer is in the last heat next to the top seeded swimmer in lane
      five and so on.
    
    
      This way, swimmers in the top three heats get the chance to swim against
      the fastest swimmers. This gives swimmers the optimal chance to make it
      into finals or consolation finals since they race the top seeds in
      preliminaries.
    

    
       tips_and_updates SCM has this as an option. You also have the option of setting the
        depth for regular seeding for earlier events.
    

    Deck Seeding
    
      Sometimes there will be no program for the meet. Instead, heat and lane
      assignments will be determined at the meet. If the meet is deck seeding,
      swimmers will check in at the meet. This is usually the case in more
      casual meets or long-distance events.
    
    
      At some less organized meets, swimmers will show up and claim a lane. This
      is usually for meets that are more for fun. Alumni meets and parent races
      often have deck seeding. Pre-seeding distance events can be problematic.
      If 50 people sign up for the 1000m and only 20 show up for the race, then
      many people will be swimming by themselves. This'll also hold up the meet
      for a really long time â€”maybe even for hours!
    
    Many meets have deck seeding solely for distance events.

    
       tips_and_updates Deck Seeding isn't an option in SCM. Currently SCM doesn't organize
        marathons or Swim-A-Thons.
    

    

    Here's an illustrated explanation of seeding lanes.
    Some ground rules.
    
      Olympic standards determine which lanes competitors are scattered into.
      The order for an eight lane pool goes something like this ....
      4,5,3,6,2,7,1,8. The algorithm used in SCM will correctly scatter for any
      sized pool. Even pools with an odd number of lanes.
    
    Consider this ...
    
    
      Each square represents a swimmer. Fastest swimmer is green, intermediate
      yellow, slowest red. A total of 32 swimmers will require four heats in an
      eight lane pool.
    
    
      Default seeding. (This algorithm is also used by 'Finals' seeding).
    
    
    
      The illustrate shows that the all top eight fastest swimmers have been
      placed in heat four. All the slowest swimmers are in the heat one.
    
    
      Circle seeding. (Also used by 'Quarter' and 'Semi'- Finals').
    

    Circle seeding is selected.
    
      In this example the seed depth will be set to two. This means the two
      fastest heats, three and four, will be circle seed.
    
    The heats one and two will use the default seed method.
    
      Note: SwimClubMeet first builds a stack of swimmers, fastest to slowest.
      Calculates the number of heats and count of swimmers needed. Then it
      builds heats, fastest to slowest. (Programmatically, circle seeding is top
      down.)
    
    
    
      It very subtle but you can see that there is now a 'spread' of fastest
      swimmers in heats 3 and 4. Your fastest swimmer is in heat 4, lane 4. the
      second fastest swimmer in heat 3, lane 4. Think of it as heat 3 and 4
      being equal.
    
    
      For competative swimming, circle seeding uses a depth equal to the number
      of heats.
    

    Why circle seed at club night?
    
      When you have many entrants to an event (say four or five heats) you may
      want to circle seed to improve the racing experience for your top
      contenders.
    
    
      It's recommended that you don't exceed a depth of three. The racing
      experience (at club level) for bottom ranked swimmers isn't improved if
      you go beyond three.
    
    Other notes
    
      When creating a 'FINAL' the default seeding is used. This a system
      default, SCM managed. Your seed settings in options are ignored.
    
    
      When creating a 'SEMI' or 'QUARTER-FINAL' circle seeding is used. (...
      again SCM managed). It's depth level is set to the number of heats.
