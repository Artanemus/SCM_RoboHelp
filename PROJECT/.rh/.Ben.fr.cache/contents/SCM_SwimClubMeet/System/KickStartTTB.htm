    

    Kick-Start Time-To-Beat (TTB).
    Your first club-night.
    
      So you have just installed SCM. Entered all your members and you are ready
      to run your first club night.
    
    
      But you have no data! None of your swimmers have any race-times stored in
      the database! How will you do an
      Auto-Build Heats?
    
    
      Firstly, auto-build will run without race data. It will fill out the heats but
      your nominees will be incorrectly matched. The algorithm needs race-times
      to create the TimeToBeat values needed to
      match-up swimmers.
    
    
      If you want to 'kick-start' your race-times then follow these steps prior
      to the start of club night ...
    

    
      ðŸ‘‰ Add a new session that pre-dates the new swimming season.
      ðŸ‘‰ Populate that session with every type of imaginable event.
      ðŸ‘‰ Create some empty heats for those events by using the Create a New Heat button.
      ðŸ‘‰ Then fill those empty lanes with your members and enter their Personal Bests into the RaceTime cell.
    
    
      Now when you run the very first SCM club night ... and you hit that
      auto-build button, entrants are correctly matched.
    

    A new member joins - mid season.
    
      The special session created above is also useful in introducing a new
      members into your club. Just add the new swimmer to your members list and
      then find the pre-dated session and add the new member to events - where a
      Personal Best is known.
    

    
    
      
        
          
        
        Tip: To speed up the assignment of a member to a lane in a heat,
        CNTRL-LMOUSE click the
        Ellipse button.
      
      
        Doing this circumnavigates the need to nominate the member, prior to
        lane assignment.
