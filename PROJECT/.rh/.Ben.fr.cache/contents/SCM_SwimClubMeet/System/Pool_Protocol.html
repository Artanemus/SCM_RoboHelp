        Tip:
        If you are running in paperless mode, that is, your are using the
        support applications SCM_Marshal and
        SCM_Timekeeper , it's good to instigate
        some pool procedure.
      
    
    
      
        A heat is considered raced when the
        Referee blows the whistle. The Chief Marshal or Referee can set the heat
        status to raced  by using the
        SCM_Marshal application..
      
      
        A heat is considered closed when all the
        race time data has been entered into the database.
      
      
        Race-times can be entered by the Chief Timekeeper at the poolside by
        using the SCM_Timekeeper application. They
        can't close the heat, only the core
        application can do that.
      
      
        After the Referee flags the heat is over the Chief Recorder does an
        Q&A and then closes the heat.
