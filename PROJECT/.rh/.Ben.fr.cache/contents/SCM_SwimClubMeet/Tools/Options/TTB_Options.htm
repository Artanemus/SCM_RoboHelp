  
Options for Time To Beat (TTB)
  
Choose the algorithm used by SCM to calculate TTB
  


  
TimeToBeat algorithm
  
Select a method to calculate the 
TIMETOBEAT
  

    
Use the last know race time of the member. 
    
Use the average of the 3 fastest race times swum by the member. 
    
Use the participants personal best.
  
  

Note: Unless specified, 'time' is calculated from data prior to the current session date.
  
TimeToBeat is used to place the entrant into the correct lane in the correct heat.
  
If the entrant's TimeToBeat is empty (NULL) then that entrant is placed in the slowest heat.
  
Members without a race times
  
An additional option that can be enabled to find a TimeToBet for entrants who are new members or haven't swum the event.
  
If there is no historical data, this option will calculate a race time for the entrant, based on the mean average of the bottom set of swimmers, for the given event. This filter takes into consideration age and gender. The filter can be further tuned by specifying the percentage portion of the lower range. The SCM default is to take the bottom 50%.
  

Why an empty TimeToBeat?
  
TimeToBeat may be empty. It's dependant on the algorithm used, what options are set and the amount of data held. The more race times recorded will produce better results when enabling 'entrants without race times'
  
Group by ...
  
Select a method to gather entrants of a simular type into their own heats. For example, if you have a membership type of boys aged 10-12, then entrants of that type will be placed into a single heat(s).
  
Seperate gender ...
  
Typically the gender table has two records, male ... female. Enabling this option, heats will contain only boys or only girls.
  
Exclude outside lanes ...
  
Band entrants from the gutter lanes. For example, if you have 8 lanes, then enabling this option will mean none of the heats will have swimmers in lanes 1 and 8.
