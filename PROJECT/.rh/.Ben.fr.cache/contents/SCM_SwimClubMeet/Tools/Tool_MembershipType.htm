    About Membership Types.
    
      On first install, SCM fills this table with some starter data. Treat this
      data as examples.
    
    
      Its main function is to create categories and separate or group
      demographics within your club.
    
    
      This grouping of members can be used to break-out veterans for masters or,
      as shown above, just separate broad age groups. The above example also
      creates a category for parent and friends but it could have created
      disability categories that aren't age dependant.
    
    The Auto-Build Heats can use this grouping to break-out heats.
    Some reports will also use these values.

    End of season audit.
    
      As groups are generally bound to DOB, an audit is required each season to push
      members into the correct grouping.
    
    
      The intention is to fully automate this. Nice big button call AUDIT. (The
      button is on the form - just not visible - still a WORK-IN_PROGRSSâœ¨.)
