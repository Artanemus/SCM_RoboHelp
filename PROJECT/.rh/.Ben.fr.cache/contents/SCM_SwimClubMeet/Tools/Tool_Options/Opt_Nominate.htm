    Options - Nominate.
    Extended options for nominations.
    
    Un-nominate warning message.
    
      If you are clearing a nomination for an event (in the nominate tab-sheet),
      but the nominee has been given entrant status (the member has been placed
      into a heat), then if this option is checked, you'll be shown a warning
      message. The default is unchecked.
    
    
      Worded differently - Test if the nominee has been given a lane in the
      event prior to clearing the nomination.
