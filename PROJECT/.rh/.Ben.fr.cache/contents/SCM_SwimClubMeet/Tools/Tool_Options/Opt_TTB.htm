    TimeToBeat algorithm

    
    TimeToBeat (TTB) - Primary option
    
      The time-to-beat determine which heat and lanes the entrant will be placed
      into. The TTB is calculated on demand.
    
    You have a pick of three algorithms.
    
      
        ðŸ‘‰ Use the last known race-time. SCM will excluding the current session
        when searching. If nothing is found. SCM uses the secondary option, if
        enabled.
      
      
        ðŸ‘‰ Use the average of the 3 fastest race-times. The search excludes the
        current session and sessions that post dates the current. An average
        race-time is calculated. Finding only one record is acceptable. If none
        are found, SCM moves to the secondary option, if enabled
      
      
        ðŸ‘‰ Use particpants personal best (PB). If nothing is found, SCM uses the
        secondary option, if enabled. Else the entrant is placed in the slowest
        heat.
      
      
        Unless specified, TTB is calculated from data that pre-dates the current
        selected session.
      
    

    
    Members without race-times - Secondary option.
    
      For entrants new to the event type, this algorithm will use brute force to
      find a race-time and calculate a TTB. The process goes like this...
    
    
      If a member doesn't have any race time data, then a time is calculated
      based on the mean average of the bottom 50% (default), with consideration
      to age and gender.
    
    
      If there's still insufficient data, SCM will ignore gender and try once
      more.
    
    
      If there is still not enough data (at least 4 records) then it will
      re-calculate, doing an age spread (plus or minus 1 year). There are
      currently no options for you to adjust minimum records and the spread
      values.
    

    
      If after all this, a suitable race time can't be found, then the
      TimeToBeat is left empty. This effectively places the swimmer in the
      slowest heats.
