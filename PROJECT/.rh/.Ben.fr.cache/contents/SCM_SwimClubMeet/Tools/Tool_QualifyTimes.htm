    Tools - Qualify Times

    
      
        A list of swimming times needed to qualify for an event.
      
    
    
      
        
      
    

    
    What are qualification times?
    
      Qualification Times (QT) are the minimum swimming times allowed for a
      given distance and stroke.
    
    
      A swimmer must be able to complete the event within the QT, else the
      swimmer is ineligible to swim that event.
    
    QT are age and gender specific.
    
      SCM uses seperate QT tabels for short and long course. What table you see
      is dependant on your clubs
      length of pool settings. Pools 30.4m or less
      (33yards) are considered short courses.
    
    
      When SCM is first installed it fills both long course and short course
      data into the table. That way, right out of the box, you can use the
      feature.
    
    
      If you intend to make changes to this table, please remember that SCM
      requires you to enter data for all genders.

            In the Nominate tabsheet there is a Qualify toggle button.
            
              When you enable this button, the letter 'Q' appears prefix next to
              each event a club member is qualified to swim.
            

            Other instances include...
            
              Qualification is flagged in the Self-Nominate support application.
            
            
              In the Pre-Nomination support application, it flags qualification
              when it emails each members a PDF nomination form.
            
            Various reports also display the qualification status.
            The SCM_Carnival application can exclude participants from entering events they are not qualified to swim.

        Info: Most swimming clubs don't use qualification times for 25m events.
        On first install, SCM doesn't provide the table information for this distance.
        If you need it, simply add it.
