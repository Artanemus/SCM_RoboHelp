              Some of your club members will change their age mid season. This
              may effect what division they fall into when swimming the session.
              If you aren't using divisions, then from start of season would be
              acceptable. You must decide.

              Future versions will allow for an accumulative score across
              multi-sessions. This would be useful if you wanted to know who
              were this years club champions for each division. Or overall best
              performer. Details you might like to know when handing out
              swimming ribbons at your awards night.

            ðŸ‘‰ The heat.
            For each heat, the swimmer is placed and scored.
            ðŸ‘‰ The event.
            
              After all the heats in the event have been swum, SCM lists each
              swimmer, fastest to slowest. Then based on their place within this
              list, they and scored.
            
            Placement is calculated ...
            ðŸ‘‰ Absolute
            
              A swimmer is placed as ordered in the race (be it the heat or the
              event).
            
            ðŸ‘‰ Relative (overall position within the division)
            
              With the close of the event, swimmers are sorted and ordered into
              separate lists for each division. Swimmers are then scored based
              on their position in these lists. (be it the heat or the event).
            
          
        
      
    

    
      The setup might appear complex a first. Clubs don't all score championship
      in the same way. The above schema give you the flexibility to chose a
      method that is best suited to your club.

            (DEVELOPER: This layout is horrible - in future releases expect
            changes.)
            
              The first 32 places can be given a score. The logic behind this
              madness goes a bit like this..
            
            
              If the settings are
              EVENT - ABSOLUTE or
              EVENT - RELATIVE
            
            
              In an event that has 4 heats with 8 swimmers, with this crazy
              number of editboxes, it's possible to give everyone points. Most
              school carnivals like to give all participants a point or two. It
              makes the leaderboard light-up.
            
            
              If the settings are
              HEAT - ABSOLUTE or
              HEAT - RELATIVE
            
            
              You only need values for the first eight places (assuming your
              pool has eight lanes.)
            
            
              If you want more than 32 places to assign points, then pop into
              the database and append additional records. (WARNING: Experience
              needed.)
            
            
              Tenths of a point are allowed. Using tenths can make for better
              competition.
            
            Leave the field empty (00.0) for a place to be unscored.
            
              The last thing to mention is Unplaced points ... here we can
              assign a value to the swimmers who came 33rd or greater. (I don't
              believe I typed that.) This option is disabled. Currently these
              swimmers are scored zero. In future version of SCM you will be
              able to edit it and you will also be given an option to set the
              cut-off point for swimmer placement.
            
          
        
      
    

    
    Divisions

    
      
        
      
      
        
          
            
            A division is an age range for a given gender. Ages are inclusive.
            The
            Age From value must be less or equal
            to the Age To value.
            Divisions are used when the score setup is RELATIVE.
            You may have division that form INTERSECTIONS and INCLUSIONS.
            An example
            
              A .. Girl's 8 years (8-8)
              B .. Girl's 9 years (9-9)
              C ... Girl's 8-12 years (8-12)
            
            
              Both A and B are a subsets of C. (Division C holds the 'grand
              finalists' for the under 12 girl's.)
            
            
              Members in this example will be scored twice. this will
              be delineated in reports, as each member's scores will be
              described within the division that derived the score.
            
            The power of divisions are - you can mix everybody into an event, without consideration to age or gender, and out spits all the correct placing and scoring. Magic.

    LeaderBoard - In Detail.

    Pressing Update will refresh the leaderboard display.
    
      What the leaderboard displays is determined by your setting in the
      preceding tabsheets (wit. SetUp, Score and Division).
    
    IMPORTANT : Only events that are CLOSED are scored.
    
      WARNING : Dead heats are score incorrectly. In future versions of SCM this
      will be fixed.
    
    
      NOTE: the description text in the top header that describes the setup that
      produced the display.
    
    To print the leaderboard go to the report tabsheet. A re-calculation (or data refresh) is always done prior to printing.

    
    Report
    The Reports build by the core application are for diagnostics.
    
      If you desire a simple, clean, user friendly report on the current
      session, then use the Score's LeaderBoad output. Goto the menubar and
      follow the bread crumbs...
      Tools âž¡ Score... âž¡ LeaderBoard and press the
      Update button. Ensure it's formatted
      correctly before moving to the next tab,
      Reports, and press the
      LeaderBoard button.
    
    
      Remember, to produce a fully finalized score report, all heats must have been swum and closed.
    
    
      The SCM_LeaderBoard application offer a much
      simpler path to score report production.
