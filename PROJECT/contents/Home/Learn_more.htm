  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Why is SCM best suited to local swimming clubs?</h3>
  <h4>Your local swimming club differs from a large competitive event in many ways.</h4>
  <p>Typically a local swim club look like this ...</p>
  <p>Nominations for events happens at the pool gate. Parents are keen to get the night&#39;s event started so they can get the kids home and to bed, but the night start&#39;s slowly, there&#39;s a cue to nominate.</p>
  <p>Most club&#39;s have small membership numbers, say 50-80 swimmers, so it&#39;s normal to mix gender and ages into individual heats.   </p>
  <p>Parents are given the jobs of timekeeper or marshal. And someone is sitting in a corner, entering race-times, probably into a spread sheet. There&#39;s lots of paper being couried around the pool.</p>
  <p>What&#39;s needed</p>
  <ul class="Disc">
    <li>Quickly get members nominated.</li>
    <li>Remove printer ink and paper.</li>
    <li>A single button to assign swimmers to events. </li>
    <li>Collect timekeeper&#39;s race-times easily.</li>
    <li>Store and archive some basic member&#39;s details. (name, age, gender and swimming history.)</li>
    <li>Tabulate a report of the night&#39;s session .</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">SCM&#39;s charter.</h3>
  <p>SCM is focused on &#39;what is needed&#39; and most importantly, keep it simple. </p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Just getting started .... (I have just a lap-top and printer)</h3>
  <p>SwimClubMeet is the core app - it does it all. It creates sessions and events, nominate and Auto-Builds all your heats, enter race-times. It also manages members details. It does reporting.  </p>
  <p>It&#39;ll print-out all the forms you need. Such as the Marshall&#39;s rally sheet and Timekeeper&#39;s entry sheet. At the end of the night you can create a session report for distribution to parent and friends.</p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">If you have the resources ... Wi-Fi, more than one computer (touch screen?) </h3>
  <p>Got two computers and a hub or wi-fi. Connect the two, share the SQL server and run SwimClubMeet on both. Nominate swimmers twice as fast.</p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Go one step further ...</h3>
  <p>Then there&#39;s the support applications.</p>
  <p><img src="../assets/images/SCM_GroupOfIcons.png" /></p>
  <p>SCM gives you a simple kiosk type app for members to <span style="font-weight:bold;">self-nominate</span> at the entry gate. (Designed for MS Surface PRO)</p>
  <p>You may wish to use the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Marshall </span>and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Timekeeper </span>apps for a <span style="font-weight:bold;">paperless</span> club night. (Designed for MS Surface PRO).</p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">In development</h3>
  <p>A stand-alone app just to <span style="font-weight:bold;">manage membership data</span>, should you wish to delegate tasks.</p>
  <p>A l<span style="font-weight:bold;">eader-board </span>app to track swimmer and house scores, in real time. (for you club&#39;s end-of-season finals)</p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Future ideas and plans</h3>
  <p> </p>
  <ul class="Disc">
    <li>A statistical package. Lots of charts and stats, for the annual committee meeting.</li>
    <li>A &#39;Carnival&#39; application to make it easy for neighboring clubs to challenge each other to a &#39;swim-off&#39;.</li>
    <li>A &#39;Report&#39;s&#39; package for some additional forms, for example, bar-coded membership cards, accreditation and podium certificates, etc.</li>
    <li>Android versions of nominate, marshal and timekeeper apps.</li>
    <li>A pre-nominate app that uses email and PDF data-forms. Fully automated. (Avoids using web services, keeps it simple)</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Help ... anyone?</h3>
  <p>SCM includes documentation on all it&#39;s features. (This is a work-in-progress. There is also an online version which is updated regularly.)</p>
