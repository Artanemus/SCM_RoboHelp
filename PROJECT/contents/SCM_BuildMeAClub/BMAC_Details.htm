  </div>

    <p>You now have a SwimClubMeet database.</p>


    <h3 class="scm-h3">What it does</h3>    
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      When you press this button it will first make some checks. If the
      application discovers you already have a SwimClubMeet database on you SQL
      server, it'll abort. SCM_BuildMeAClub uses the sqlcmd.exe commandline
      utility when processing these scripts. SQLcmd.exe is installed by default
      when use first install SQLEXPRESS. The application will check that you
      have SQLcmd.exe installed. If it can't find the utility it will abort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The application has a large number of SQL scripts that it will run on the
      SQL server. As it runs it will display it's progress and display
      information in the application's text window.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will create the SwimClubMeet database, create all of the tables,
      procedures and scalar functions. Then it will populate some of the tables
      with 'starter' data. Next it creates users and roles. It will assign
      permissions for each role on each table.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the SQL server performs it's given tasks it will log it's progress to a
      file created in the user's document folder. That file is named
      SCM_BuildMeAClub.log. If the SQL server encounters any errors, it will log
      the errors to this file.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the command line utility SQLcmd.exe encounters an error, it will log
      the error to the SCM_BuildMeAClub text windows.
    </p>
    <p>Typically the whole build process is over within a minute or two.</p>
