  <p><img class="SCM_Image" src="../../assets/images/image3.png" /><span>SQLEXPRESS comes with the default Windows Authentication mode when you first install it locally. With the Windows authentication mode, SQLEXPRESS can validate a user by their Windows username and password. This means the password is not required once the user is logged into the Windows system. </span></p>
  <p><span>The alternative method, the SQLEXPRESS authentication mode enables a user login (which is different from a Windows login).</span> To use SQLEXPRES authentication mode you must give a user name and password. The SwimClubMeet database has a pre-installed user and schema, scmAdmin. Some additional security setup at the root level is required before scmAdmin can be used. </p>
  <p>Also pre-installed are the roles, SCM_Administrator, SCM_Marshall and SCM_Guest. These roles have special permission mappings on all the SwimClubMeet tables. For example the role, SCM_Guest can only read SwimClubMeet tables.</p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Examples of Server IP or Named Path.:</h3>
  <p>192.168.0.1:1433</p>
  <p>The above example uses an IP address and port number</p>
  <p>localHost\SQLEXPRESS</p>
  <p><span><span>In this example the 'localhost' is a hostname that refers to the local machine currently making the request. On many computers, localhost is an alias for the IP address 127.0.0.1. When a computer pings this IP address, it is communicating with itself. The 'SQLEXPRESS' after the backslash refers to the registered server name or instance of the SQL database server.</span></span></p>
  <p>DESKTOP-KN145\SQLEXPRESS</p>
  <p>The above example uses a computer name and server instance name. <span>A computer name is a unique identifier that is given to each computer. A computer name can be used to identify the computer on a domain or network.</span></p>
