        />SQLEXPRESS comes with the default Windows Authentication mode when you
        first install it locally. With the Windows authentication mode,
        SQLEXPRESS can validate a user by their Windows username and password.
        This means the password is not required once the user is logged into the
        Windows system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The alternative method, the SQLEXPRESS authentication mode enables a
        user login (which is different from a Windows login). To use SQLEXPRESS
        authentication mode you must give a user name and password. The
        SwimClubMeet database has a pre-installed user and schema, scmAdmin. Some
        additional security setup at the root level is required before scmAdmin
        can be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also pre-installed are the roles, SCM_Administrator, SCM_Marshal and
        SCM_Guest. These roles have special permission mappings on all the
        SwimClubMeet tables. For example the role, SCM_Guest can only read
        SwimClubMeet tables.

      <h3 class="scm-h3">Examples of Server IP or Named Path.:</h3>
      <p>192.168.0.1:1433</p>
      <p>The above example uses an IP address and port number</p>
      <p>localHost\SQLEXPRESS</p>
      <p>
        In this example the 'localhost' is a hostname that refers to the local
        machine currently making the request. On many computers, localhost is an
        alias for the IP address 127.0.0.1. When a computer pings this IP
        address, it is communicating with itself. The SQLEXPRESS after the
        backslash refers to the registered server name or instance of the SQL
        database server.
      </p>
      <p>MyComuterName\SQLEXPRESS</p>
      <p>
        The above example uses a computer name and server instance name. A
        computer name is a unique identifier that is given to each computer. A
        computer name can be used to identify the computer on a domain or
        network.
