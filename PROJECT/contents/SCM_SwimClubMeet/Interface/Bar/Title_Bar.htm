              <h4 class="SCM_h4">5. Refresh.</h4>
              <p>
                An important button if you are using the support apps (Marshall,
                Nominate, TimeKeeper, etc). As these external apps can change
                data within you Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS SwimClubMeet database,
                this refresh button re-syncs the core app.
              </p>
              <p>
                The core application does auto-resync at set points in the code.
                For example : When you move between tabsheets it will
                requery tables pertaining to the tabsheet you selected. The
                refresh button is a more inclusive, an all incompassing
                re-sync. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are some examples when a refresh might be in order: <br />
                ðŸ‘‰ If the Marshall disqualifies swimmers, then after a re-fresh
                you'll see the heat display check marks in the disqualified
                box.<br />
                ðŸ‘‰ If the Timekeeper enters swimmers race times, then after a
                re-fresh, those times will appears in each entrant's lane.<span
                ></span>

         Tip:
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are running in paperless mode, that is, your are using the
        support applications <span class="SCM_Term">SCM_Marshal</span> and
        <span class="SCM_Term">SCM_TimeKeeper</span> , it's good to instigate
        some pool procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        A heat is considered <span class="SCM_Quote">raced</span> when the
        Referee blows the whistle. The Chief Marshal or Referee can set the heat
        status to <span class="SCM_Quote">raced </span> by using the
        <span class="SCM_Term">SCM_Marshal</span> application..
      </p>
      <p>
        A heat is considered <span class="SCM_Quote">closed</span> when all the
        race time data has been entered into the database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Race-times can be entered by the Chief Timekeeper at the poolside by
        using the <span class="SCM_Term">SCM_TimeKeeper</span> application. They
        can't <span class="SCM_Quote">close</span> the heat, only the core
        application can do that.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Referee flags the heat is over the Chief Recorder does an
        Q&amp;A and then <span class="SCM_Quote">closes</span> the heat.
