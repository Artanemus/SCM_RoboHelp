      Note that in the <span class="scm-term">Entrant's Name</span> cell, you
      can't edit the swimmer's name. The only active part is the
      <span class="scm-kbm">ellipse</span> button, which is located at the far
      end of the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ellipse button has two methods activated by
      <span class="scm-kbm">LMOUSE</span> click or
      <span class="scm-kbm">CNTRL+LMOUSE</span> click.

    <!-- ELLIPSE BUTTON METHOD 1 -->
    <h3 class="scm-h3"><a id="Heat_Ellipse1"></a>Ellipse button. Method 1.</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="scm-kbm">LMOUSE</span> click the ellipse button to open the
      <span class="scm-mi">Quick Pick Nominee</span> dialogue.
    </p>

    <table class="scm-table_img">
      <colgroup>
        <col />
      </colgroup>

            />
            <p>
              The swimmers listed in this dialogue are all nominees that haven't
              been given a lane in the current selected event.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the quick-pick list is empty, then every nominee has a lane.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clicking a column heading will sort by that column. Click again
              will invert the sort.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the list is very long, then use the search box. It used
              wildcards, so you only a need snippet of the nominee's name. It
              reacts in real time to your key strokes. To see the full list
              again, clear the search box.
            </p>
            <p>
              The TimeToBeat, PersonalBest, AGE and Gender will give you useful
              information on whom to pick and where to place in the current
              selected heat.
            </p>
            <p>
              ðŸ‘‰ <span class="scm-kbm">DOUBLE LMOUSE</span> click on the chosen
              record to place the nominee into the lane.
            </p>
            <p>
              ðŸ‘‰ Or select nominee then click the
              <span class="scm-kbm">Post</span> button.
            </p>
            <p>
              ðŸ‘‰ To close the dialogue without making any changes, click the
              <span class="scm-kbm">Cancel</span> button.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the lane is filled with a swimmer prior to opening the
              Quick-Pick dialogue, then the swimmer get's 'bumped' out of the
              lane and is replaced with the selected nominee. The 'bumped'
              swimmer will be returned to the nominee's stack, awaiting a lane
              assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the lane is empty, prior to opening the Quick-Pick, then that
              lane will be filled with the nominee you chose.

    <!-- ELLIPSE BUTTON. METHOD 2 -->
    <h3 class="scm-h3"><a id="Heat_Ellipse2"></a>Ellipse button. Method 2.</h3>
    <p>
      This method differs in that you
      <span class="scm-kbm">CNTRL-LMOUSE</span> click the cell's
      <span class="scm-kbm">Ellipse</span> button to open the
      <span class="scm-mi">Quick Pick Member</span> dialogue.

              alt="Members QuickPick Dialogue"
            />
            <p>
              This dialogue may appear very similar to method 1, but if you look
              closely you'll notice that the title is different. Also the list
              is likely to be significantly larger.
            </p>
            <p>
              The functionality of this dialogue is identical to the previous
              (method 1).
            </p>
            <p>
              This dialogue displays all active club members who do swim with
              one exception - Members who have been given a lane in the current
              selected event are excluded.
            </p>
            <p>The semantics is different...</p>
            <p>
              If you assign a member from this list to a lane then you have also
              nominated that member for the event. 'Two birds with one stone'.
              You created both a nominee and an entrant.
