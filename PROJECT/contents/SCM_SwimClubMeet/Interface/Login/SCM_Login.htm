      SQLEXPRESS.
    </h3>

    <p>
      On start-up, SwimClubMeet (or any ofthe other support applications) will
      display the login dialogue. This dialogue enables you to connection to
      Microsoft's SQLSERVER.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's here that you enter the server name. This can be a
      <span class="scm_term">named path</span> (or
      <span class="scm_term">instance</span>). As shown in the image.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another way the server name can be given is in the form of a IP address
      and optionally a port number. (eg. 127.0.0.1:1433). Typically an IP
      address is used if you are remotely accessing the database server. For
      example, when using the <span class="scm_term">SCM_Nominate</span>,
      <span class="scm_term">SCM_Marshal</span> and
      <span class="scm_term">SCM_Timekeeper</span> support applications. Remote
      access will require a user name and password.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <span class="scm_mi">OS Authentication</span> to work, there are
      prerequisite. SQL Server Express comes with the default Windows
      Authentication mode when you first install it locally. With the Windows
      authentication mode, SQL Server validates a user by their Windows username
      and password. This means the password is not required once the user is
      logged into the Windows system.
    </p>

    <p>A valid connection is required else the application can't run.</p>

    <h3 class="scm_h3">
      <a id="Preassigned_Login_UserNames"></a>Pre-assigned remote user names.
    </h3>

    <p>
      SCM SQL database has pre-assigned roles. They are SCM_Administrator,
      SCM_Marshal and SCM_Guest. Each role has limited access to tables and
      records.
    </p>

    <p>
      SCM_Administrator can read and write to all tables in the SCM database.
      (wit: a SCM superuser).
    </p>

    <p>
      SCM_Marshal can read all but can only write to event, entrant and
      nominate tables. SCM_Marshal can modify racetimes, entrant nominations,
      disqualify and scratch entrants.
    </p>

    <p>
      SCM_Guest can read specific tables, so as to see the night's events and
      swimmers times and placing. They also can view the leader-board.
    </p>

    <p>
      On install, a scmAdmin user and profile is created. It is a ssigned the
      SCM_Administrator role. The account hasn't been assigned a password and
      isn't activated. Use MSSMS to enable the account and set the password.

        Note: For security reasons, don't be tempted to use the SQLSERVER
        <span class="scm_term">su</span>
        account as quick short-cut to remote login. The SCM pre-defined user
        schemas give you much greater security.
