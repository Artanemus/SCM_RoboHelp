  <h2 class="SCM_h2">Your first club night with SCM.</h2>
  <h4>Here&#39;s an outline of what needs to be done to get started. </h4>
  <ol class="Decimal">
    <li>You need swimmers. Use the <span class="SCM_Keyboard">Club Members</span> button and add your members.<br />
      <br />
      <span class="SCM_Quotes">TIP: Get yourself comfortable, this is going to take some time. Good news - you only do this once. Minimum requirements are FirstName, LastName, DOB and gender.</span><br />
      <br />
       
    </li>
    <li>Add a new &quot;Session&quot; in the &quot;Session Table&quot;. <span style="border-bottom:undefined;border-color:#000000;border-left:undefined;border-right:undefined;border-style:none;border-top:undefined;border-width:1px;">With that session selected ...<br />
        <br />
        <span class="SCM_Quotes">TIP: A short note makes the session memorable. &#39;Clear skies and bar-b-que&#39;.</span></span><br />
      <br />
       
    </li>
    <li style="border-width: 1px;border-style: none;border-color: #000000">Add your events into the &quot;Events Table&quot; by entering &quot;Distance&quot; and &quot;Stroke&quot;. <br />
      <br />
      <span class="SCM_Quotes">TIP: If you need to describe your events. Click the expander button to expand the event grid. The &#39;description&#39; column is now visible. Any text entered here will be seen by everyone and displayed in every report.</span><br />
      <br />
       
    </li>
    <li>Select the next tab-sheet - Nominate. Here you select the swimmer then check the events they will be swimming.<br />
      <br />
      <span class="SCM_Quotes">TIP: Need to know if they are &#39;Qualified&#39; to swim the event. Toggle the &#39;Qualified&#39; button  on.</span><br />
      <br />
       
    </li>
    <li>Select the next tab-sheet - Heats. Press the <span class="SCM_Keyboard">Build Heats</span> button for each event. Be aware, your database, at this stage, is totally empty. So your swimmers will not be &#39;matched-up&#39; correctly. (See the special note below.) <br />
      <br />
      <span class="SCM_Quotes">TIP: There&#39;s a &#39;build all heats&#39; in the menu bar.</span><br />
      <br />
       
    </li>
    <li>You are ready to print the marshal and time-keepers&#39; forms.<br />
      <br />
      <span class="SCM_Quotes">TIP: If the &#39;print-set&#39; button isn&#39;t enough, there&#39;s a &#39;print all marshal and timekeeper forms&#39; in the menu bar. But beware, the windows print spooler is probably turned on and that&#39;s a lot of paper. <br />
      </span><br />
       
    </li>
    <li>When a heat has been swum - enter the swimmers&#39; times into the &quot;race time&#39;&#39; column.<br />
      <br />
      <span class="SCM_Quotes">TIP: Arrow down to move to the next race time.</span><br />
      <br />
       
    </li>
    <li>When the session is completed, print the session report to PDF and email.<br />
      <br />
      <span class="SCM_Quotes">TIP: Check-out the &#39;qualified swimmers report&#39; in tools &gt;&gt; qualification times</span>.<br />
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>That it. </p>
  <p>Here&#39;s a link to a YouTube Video that takes you through the above process.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Special note:</h3>
  <p><span class="SCM_Quotes">If you want to &#39;kick-start&#39; your TimeToBet algorithm (you have just installed the application and you have no race data) add a new session that is dated prior to the new swimming season. Populate that session with every type of event. Then fill selected events with the personal best race-times for each of your members. That way when the very first SCM club night is played ... entrants are correctly placed. This also a useful technic for new members that join late in the season.</span></p>
