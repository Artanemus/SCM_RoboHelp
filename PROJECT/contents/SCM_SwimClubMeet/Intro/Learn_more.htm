  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Why is SCM best suited toÂ local swimming clubs?</h3>
  <h4>Your local swimming club differs from a large competitiveÂ event in many ways.</h4>
  <p>Typically a local swim club look like this ...</p>
  <p>Nominations for events happens at the pool gate. Parents are keenÂ to get the event&#39;s started so they can get the kids home and to bed, but the night start&#39;s slowly, there&#39;s a cue toÂ nominate.</p>
  <p>Most club&#39;s have small membership numbers, say 50-80 swimmers, so it&#39;s normal to mixÂ gender and agesÂ into individual heats. Â Â </p>
  <p>Parents are given the jobs of timekeeperÂ orÂ marshal. And someone is sitting in a corner, with a laptop,Â setting the meet up, probably into a spread sheet. There&#39;s lots of paper being couriered around the pool.</p>
  <p>What&#39;s needed ...</p>
  <p>Quickly get members nominated.<br />
    A simple way to nominate.<br />
    A single button to build heats.<br />
    Remove printer ink and paper.<br />
    Collect timekeeper&#39;s race-times easily.<br />
    Store and archive some basic member&#39;s details.Â (name,Â age,Â gender and swimmingÂ history.)<br />
    Tabulate a reportÂ of the night&#39;s sessionÂ .</p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">SCM&#39;s charter.</h3>
  <p>SCMÂ is focused on &#39;what isÂ needed&#39; and most importantly, keep it simple.Â </p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Just getting started .... (I have just a lap-top and printer)</h3>
  <p>SwimClubMeet is the core app - it does it all. It creates sessions and events, nominateÂ andÂ Auto-Builds all your heats,Â enterÂ race-times. It also manages members details. It does reporting.Â Â </p>
  <p>It&#39;ll print-out all the forms you need. Such as the Marshall&#39;s rally sheet and Timekeeper&#39;s entry sheet. At the end of the night you can create a session report for distribution to parent and friends.</p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">If you have the resources ... Wi-Fi, more than one computer (touch screen?)Â </h3>
  <p>Got two computers and a hub or wi-fi. Connect the two, share the SQL server and run SwimClubMeet on both. Nominate swimmers twice as fast.</p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Go one step further ...</h3>
  <p>Then there&#39;s the support applications.</p>

        <td><img class="scmImage" src="../../assets/images/Interface/SCM_GroupOfIcons.png" />
          <p>SCM gives you a simple kiosk type app for members to <span style="font-weight:bold;">self-nominate</span> at the entry gate.Â (Designed for MS Surface PRO)</p>
          <p>You may wish to use the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Marshall </span>and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Timekeeper </span>apps for a <span style="font-weight:bold;">paperless</span> club night. (Designed for MS Surface PRO).</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Currently in development</h3>
  <p>A stand-alone app just to <span style="font-weight:bold;">manage membership data</span>, should you wish to delegate tasks.</p>
  <p>A <span style="font-weight:bold;">leader-board </span>app to track swimmer and house scores, in real time. (for you club&#39;s end-of-season finals)</p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Future ideas and plans</h3>
  <p>A SCM_StatsÂ package.Â Lots of charts and stats, for the annual committee meeting.<br />
    A SCM_CarnivalÂ application to make it easy for neighboring clubs to challenge each other to a &#39;swim-off&#39;.<br />
    A SCM_ReportÂ package for some additional forms, for example, bar-coded membership cards, accreditation and podium certificates, etc.<br />
    A SCM_PreNominate appÂ that uses email and PDF data-forms.Â Fully automated. (Avoids using web services, keeps it simple).<br />
    <br />
    All developement of SCM is being done on a cross-platform compiler. This means that Android and iOS versions of nominate, marshalÂ and timekeeper application will eventually be delivered.
  </p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Help documentation</h3>
  <p>SCM includes documentation on all it&#39;s features. This is a work-in-progress. There is also an online version which is updated regularly.</p>
