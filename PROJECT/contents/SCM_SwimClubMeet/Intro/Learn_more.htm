    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Why use SwimClubMeet?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; width: 80%">
      <span class="SCM_Quote">
        Your local swimming club differs from a large competitive event in many
        ways.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>Typically a local swim club look like this ...</p>
    <p>
      Nominations for events happens at the pool gate. Parents are keen to get
      the event's started so they can get the kids home and to bed, but the
      night start's slowly, there's a cue to nominate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most club's have small membership numbers, say 50-80 swimmers, so it's
      normal to mix gender and ages into individual heats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parents are given the jobs of timekeeper or marshal. And someone is
      sitting in a corner, with a laptop, setting the meet up, probably into a
      spread sheet. There's lots of paper being couriered around the pool.
    </p>
    <p>What's needed ...</p>
    <p>
      Quick, simple way to get members nominated.<br />
      A single button to build heats.<br />
      Easy sheet production for marshal and timekeepers. <br />
      Or better still - remove paper and ink.<br />
      Store and archive race history and some basic club member details.<br />
      Tabulate a report of the night's session.
    </p>

    <!-- MANTRA -->

    <h3 class="SCM_h3">SCM's Mantra.</h3>
    <p>
      SCM is focused on 'what is needed' and most importantly, keep it simple.
    </p>

    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Just getting started ....</h3>
    <p>All you need to get started is a lap-top and printer.</p>
    <p>
      SwimClubMeet is the core app - it does it all. It creates sessions and
      events, nominate and Auto-Builds all your heats, enter race-times. It also
      manages members details. It does reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It'll print-out all the forms you need. Such as the Marshall's rally sheet
      and Timekeeper's entry sheet. At the end of the night you can create a
      session report for distribution to parent and friends.
    </p>

    <!-- EXPAND -->
    <h3 class="SCM_h3">If you have the resources ...</h3>
    <p>Have you got a Wi-Fi, more than one computer?</p>
    <p>
      With two laptops and a router, get connected then share the database
      server and run SwimClubMeet on both. Nominate swimmers twice as fast.
    </p>

    <!-- EXPAND EVEN MORE - SUPPORT APPLICATIONS -->
    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Go one step further ...</h3>
    <p>Then there's the support applications.</p>

    <table class="SCM_tblImgText">

            />
            <p>
              SCM gives you a simple kiosk type app for members to
              <span class="SCM_Term">Self-Nominate</span> at the entry gate.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may wish to use the
              <span class="SCM_Term">Marshall </span>and
              <span class="SCM_Term">Timekeeper </span>apps for a paperless club
              night.
            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      Note: The above applications are only for MS Surface PRO or simular. Other
      platforms will be available in the future.
    </p>

    <!-- WHAT'S COMMING -->
    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Currently in development</h3>
    <p>
      A stand-alone app just to manage membership data, should you wish to
      delegate tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A leader-board app to track swimmer and house scores, in real time. This
      isfor you club's end-of-season finals and will also be used by the
      carnival application.
    </p>

    <!-- INTO THE FUTURE -->
    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Future ideas and plans</h3>
    <p>
      A stats package. Lots of charts and stats, for the annual committee
      meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A carnival application to make it easy for neighboring clubs to challenge
      each other to a 'swim-off'.
    </p>
    <p>
      A report package for some additional forms, for example, bar-coded
      membership cards, accreditation and podium certificates, etc. A
      preNominate app that uses email and PDF data-forms. Fully automated. It
      avoids using web services.
    </p>
    <p>
      All developement of SCM is being done on a cross-platform compiler. This
      means that Android and iOS versions of nominate, marshal and timekeeper
      application will eventually be delivered.
    </p>

    <!-- HELP DOCUMENTATION -->
    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Help documentation</h3>
    <p>
      SCM includes documentation on all it's features. This is a
      work-in-progress. There is also an online version which is updated
      regularly.
