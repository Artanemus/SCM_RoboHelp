  <h2 class="SCM_h2">System Specifications.</h2>
  <p>SwimClubMeet (the core application) has been designed and tested on WINDOWS 10 running Microsoft&#39;s SQLEXPRESS 2017 or higher. Your system should have a least 4.00 GB installed memory (RAM) and a least 1GB of storage. </p>
  <p>It&#39;s been noted that SwimClubMeet will run on WINDOWS 7 and SQLEXPRESS 2014, 2016, (but isn&#39;t not supported by this developer).</p>
  <p>All SCM applications are very kind on CPU resources. And you don&#39;t need a high end graphics card.</p>
  <p>Microsoft&#39;s SQLEXPRESS is a little bit more hungry. But everything has been optimized. Even with an level entry laptop and multiply connections, the performance experienced is extremely good.</p>
  <p><span class="SCM_Quotes">(Based on 4 years of beta testing with local swimming clubs in my area - Ben Ambrose, application developer.)</span></p>
