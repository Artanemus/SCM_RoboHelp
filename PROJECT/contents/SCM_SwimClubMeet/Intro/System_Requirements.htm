    <p>
      SwimClubMeet (the core application) has been designed and tested on
      Windows 10 and 11. Your system should have a least 8.00 GB installed
      memory (RAM) and a least 1GB of storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Database server specifications are Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS 2017 or higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's been noted that SwimClubMeet will run on WINDOWS 7 and SQLEXPRESS
      2014, 2016, (but isn't not supported by this developer).
    </p>
    <p>
      All SCM applications are very kind on CPU resources. And you don't need a
      high end graphics card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Microsoft's SQLEXPRESS is a little bit more hungry. But everything has
      been optimized. Even with an level entry laptop and multiply connections,
      the performance experienced is extremely good.
