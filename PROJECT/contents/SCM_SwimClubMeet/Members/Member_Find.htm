    <h4 class="SCM_h4">Enter member's name. (*WildCards*)</h4>
    <p>
      Enter text to filter the displayed list of members. Type a 'Sub-String' of
      the member's name. Spaces are ignored.
    </p>
    <h4 class="SCM_h4">Select Membership Type</h4>
    <p>
      Further filter the member listed by selecting a membership type. Use the
      variant <span class="SCM_MI">Show all membership types</span> to clear. The presets found here are created and edited in the <span class="SCM_MI">Membership Type</span> dialogue. Which is accessed by going to the <span class="SCM_MI">MenuBar</span> and following the bread crumbs <span class="SCM_MI">Tools ➡ Member Types ➡ Details</span>.
    </p>
    <h4 class="SCM_h4">CheckBox - Is-Active</h4>
    <p>Check to find member's that are currently participating in the Club.</p>

    <h4 class="SCM_h4">CheckBox - Male</h4>
    <p>
      Check to find male swimming members. At least one gender type will aways

    <p>
      Check to find female swimming members. At least one gender type will aways
      be on.

      If a member is currently selected in the table, then clicking this button
      will result in the 'Find member' dialogue closing and then cue-to the
      member within the Club's Membership database. (Identical to a
      <span class="SCM_Button">double-left-click</span>.)
    </p>
    <h4 class="SCM_h4">Close</h4>
    <p>
      Exit's from the Find Member dialogue - without performing a cue-to
      with-in the Club's Membership database.
    </p>
    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Other Notes ...</h3>
    <h4 class="SCM_h4">Other Short-Cuts</h4>
    <p>
      <span class="SCM_KBM">DOUBLE-LMOUSE</span>  click while the mouse cursor is
      hovering over a member's record will close the dialogue and cue-to the
      member within the Club's Membership database.<span></span>

      all member's, check male and female boxes, un-chech is-active box, set
