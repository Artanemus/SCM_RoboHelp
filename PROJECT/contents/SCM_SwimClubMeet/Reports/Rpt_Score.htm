    <h3 class="scm-h3">SOME IMPORTANT NOTES.</h3>
    <p>The score reports produced by the core application are for diagnostics.</p>
    <p>
      If you desire a simple, clean, user friendly report on the current
      session, then use the Score LeaderBoad output. Goto the menubar and
      follow the bread crumbs...
      <span class="scm-mi">Tools ➡ Score... ➡ LeaderBoard</span> and press the
      <span class="scm-kbm">Update</span> button. Ensure it's formatted
      correctly before moving to the next tab,
      <span class="scm-mi">Reports</span>, and press the
      <span class="scm-kbm">LeaderBoard</span> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      The format produced is reliant on the score setup. Remember, to produce a fully finalised score report, all heats must have been swum and closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="scm-term">SCM_LeaderBoard</span> application offer a much
      simpler path to score report production.

        This is the breakdown of the scores for the current selected session. It
        displays place and points for both ABSOLUTE position and RELATIVE to
        division - grouped by division, then by entrant. This detailed report
        includes aggregates for each member. This report is for diagnostics. For
        a much cleaner presentation - use the SCM_LeaderBoard application. Note
        that the title header displays how the age was calculated and what
        session it was derived from. This report can take time to build. Be
        patient. (Prepared at 75% scale.)

        This report is simular to the above, but it is group by event. This
        report is for diagnostics. Note that the title header displays how the

        friendly report scoring it's recommended that you use the
        SCM_LeaderBoard application. (Prepared at 75% scale.)
