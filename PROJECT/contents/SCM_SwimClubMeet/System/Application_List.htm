    <h3 class="scm-h3">Applications you must install to run SCM,</h3>

    <div style="display: flex">
      <div style="display: block">
        <img
          class="scm-img"
          src="../../assets/images/System/MicrosoftSQLExpress_Logo.png"
          width="140px"
        />
      </div>
      <div style="vertical-align: middle">Microsoft's SQL server Express.</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Microsoft SQL Server Express is a version of Microsoft's SQL Server
      relational database management system that is free to download, distribute
      and use. It comprises a database specifically targeted for embedded and
      smaller-scale applications. It's free.
    </p>

    <h3 class="scm-h3">Applications you are advised to install.</h3>

    <p>Microsoft's Server Management Studio. (MSSMS)</p>

    <p>
      SQL Server Management Studio is an integrated environment for managing any
      SQL infrastructure, from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database. SSMS provides
      tools to configure, monitor, and administer instances of SQL Server and
      databases. Use SSMS to deploy, monitor, and upgrade the data-tier
      components used by your applications, as well as build queries and
      scripts. It's free.
    </p>

    <h3 class="scm-h3">Standalone Applications not bundled with SCM</h3>

    <p>
      The following applications have been written in a cross platform compiler.
      It's intended that in future releases there will be Linux, Mac, iPhone,
      Android and iPad variants of these applications. When you share your
      database server over wi-fi, these remote applications collectively perform
      most of the functions that the core application can do.
    </p>

    <img
      class="scm-img"
      src="../../assets/images/icons/SCM_IconNominate.png"
    />SCM_Nominate.exe
    <p>
      Beta. This is a stand alone application. This application allows members
      to quickly nominate for the 'nights' events. It's like a kiosk - swimmers
      enter their membership number and then nominate for the listed events. Set
      up a couple of tablets at the front gate for quick event nomination.
    </p>

    <img
      class="scm-img"
      src="../../assets/images/icons/SCM_IconMarshall.png"
    />SCM_Marshal.exe
    <p>
      This is a stand alone application. This application lets your lane
      marshall to browse events and heats. Displays entrants, their lane numbers
      and race time (once they have been entered by Admin or Timekeeper) . The
      marshall can also flag a heat as 'raced'.
    </p>

    <img
      class="scm-img"
      src="../../assets/images/icons/SCM_IconTimeKeeper.png"
    />SCM_Timekeeper.exe
    <p>
      This application lets your timekeepers track events, heats for their
      assigned lane. It shows the entrant name, timetobeat and personal best for
      the assign lane. The timekeeper may enter the race time for the entrant
      which is then sent to the server. Or set the roaming feature on. This
      enabled one Grand Timekeeper Official to collect each lane's time for each
      heat run. SCM_LeaderBoard, Beta. This is a windows 10 only, stand alone
      application. It uses a local SQLiteV3 to optimize performance and remove
      the load off the core MSSQL Server. This application allows you to track
      member, house and event scores, in real time. It includes a report system.
      Use this application to track scores for your end-of-season finals. May
      serve as a billboard. SCM_Help. Help for SwimClubMeet. Forever a work in
      progress.
