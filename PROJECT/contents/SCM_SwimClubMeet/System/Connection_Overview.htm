    <h2 class="scm_h2">Connection Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Here is a visual guide to connecting the SCM applications and an overview
      of system settings. In this example the club is running paperless and can
      potentially have up to 4 stations from which to nominate. This would suit
      a very large swimming club. Up to 240+ nominees - roughly 15 minutes+ to
      get them through the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three computers is a good start. 2 x touch screens (Microsoft edge pro)
      and a laptop to run the server and core application. The touch screens are used for self-nomination and then are re-tasked for referee and chief timekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an additional laptop can deligate tasks. It can used to add new members, update details and nominate members.
