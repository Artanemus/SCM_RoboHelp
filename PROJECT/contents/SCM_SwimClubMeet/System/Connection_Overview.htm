    <h2 class="SCM_h2">Connection Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Here is a visual guide to connecting the SCM applications and an overview
      of system settings. Run paperless and speed-up nominations
    </p>
    <p>
      Three computers would be a good start. 2 x touch screens (Microsoft edge
      pro) and a laptop to run the server and core application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps a fourth computer to run SCM_Member or a 2nd instance of the core
      application. This additional computer could be used to answer/update
      members queries/details, add new members and for nominations to events.
      With four points from which to nominate - this would suit a very large
      swimming club (up to 240+ nominees - roughly 15 minutes+ to get them
      through the gate).
