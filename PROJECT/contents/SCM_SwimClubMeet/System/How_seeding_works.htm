    <h2 class="scm-h2">SCM How seeding works</h2>
    <p>Here's an illustrated explanation of seeding lanes.</p>
    <p>Some ground rules.</p>
    <p>
      Olympic standards determine which lanes competitors are scattered into.
      The order for an eight lane pool goes something like this ....
      4,5,3,6,2,7,1,8. The algorithm used in SCM will correctly scatter for any
      sized pool. Even pools with an odd number of lanes.
    </p>
    <p>Consider this ...</p>
    <p><img src="../../assets/images/Interface/SeedA.JPG" /></p>
    <p>
      Each square represents a swimmer. Fastest swimmer is green, intermediate
      yellow, slowest red. A total of 32 swimmers will require four heats in an
      eight lane pool.
    </p>
    <h4>Default seeding. (This algorithm is also used by 'Finals' seeding).</h4>
    <p><img src="../../assets/images/Interface/SeedB.JPG" /></p>
    <p>
      The illustrate shows that the all top eight fastest swimmers have been
      placed in heat four. All the slowest swimmers are in the heat one.
    </p>
    <h4 style="border-width: 1px; border-style: none; border-color: #000000">
      Circle seeding. (Also used by 'Quarter' and 'Semi'- Finals').
    </h4>

    <p style="float: inherit; clear: none">Circle seeding is selected.</p>
    <p>
      In this example the seed depth will be set to two. This means the two
      fastest heats, three and four, will be circle seed.
    </p>
    <p>The heats one and two will use the default seed method.</p>
    <p>
      Note: SwimClubMeet first builds a stack of swimmers, fastest to slowest.
      Calculates the number of heats and count of swimmers needed. Then it
      builds heats, fastest to slowest. Hence circle seeding is top down.
    </p>
    <p><img src="../../assets/images/Interface/SeedC.JPG" /></p>
    <p>
      It very subtle but you can see that there is now a 'spread' of fastest swimmers in heats
      3 and 4. Your fastest swimmer is in heat 4, lane 4. the second fastest
      swimmer in heat 3, lane 4. Think of it as heat 3 and 4 being equal.
    </p>
    <p>For competative swimming, circle seeding uses a depth equal to the number of heats. </p>

    <h4>Why circle seed at club night?</h4>
    <p>
      When you have many entrants to an event (say four or five heats) you may
      want to circle seed to improve the racing experience for your top
      contenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's recommended that you don't exceed a depth of three. The racing
      experience (at club level) for bottom ranked swimmers isn't improved if you
      go beyond three.
    </p>
    <h4>Other notes</h4>
    <p>
      When creating a 'FINAL' the default seeding is used. This a system
      default, SCM managed. Your seed settings in options are ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      When creating a 'SEMI' or 'QUARTER-FINAL' circle seeding is used. (...
      again SCM managed). It's depth level is set to the number of heats.
