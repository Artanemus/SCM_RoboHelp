    <h2 class="SCM_h2">Kick-Start Time-To-Beat (TTB).</h2>
    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Your first club-night.</h3>
    <p>
      So you have just installed SCM. Entered all your members and you are ready
      to run your first club night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you have no data! None of your swimmers have any race-times stored in
      the database! How will you do an
      <span class="SCM_Term">Auto-Build Heats</span>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, auto-build will run without race data. It will fill out the heats but
      your nominees will be incorrectly matched. The algorithm needs race-times
      to create the <span class="SCM_Term">TimeToBeat</span> values needed to
      match-up swimmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to 'kick-start' your race-times then follow these steps prior
      to the start of club night ...
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px">
      <p>ðŸ‘‰ Add a new session that pre-dates the new swimming season.</p>
      <p>ðŸ‘‰ Populate that session with every type of imagineable event.</p>
      <p>ðŸ‘‰ Create some empty heats for those events by using the <span class="SCM_KBM">Create a New Heat</span> button.</p>
      <p>ðŸ‘‰ Then fill those empty lanes with your members and enter their <span class="SCM_Term">Personal Bests</span> into the <span class="SCM_MI">RaceTime</span> cell.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Now when you run the very first SCM club night ... and you hit that
      auto-build button, entrants are correctly matched.
    </p>

    <h3 class="SCM_h3">A new member joins - mid season.</h3>
    <p>
      The special session created above is also useful in introducing a new
      members into your club. Just add the new swimmer to your members list and
      then find the pre-dated session and add the new member to events - where a
      Personal Best is known.

        Tip: To speed up the assignment of a member to a lane in a heat,
        <span class="SCM_KBM">CNTRL-LMOUSE</span> click the
        <span class="SCM_KBM">Ellipse</span> button.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing this circumnavigates the need to nominate the member, prior to
        lane assignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a link to the full description on how to use the above method ... <a href="../Interface/Heats/Heat_ManualBuild.html#Heat_Ellipse2">link</a>
