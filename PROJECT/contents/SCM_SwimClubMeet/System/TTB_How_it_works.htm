      There is only one set of parameters. The two above methods modify the same
      set. The methods are congruent.
    </p>

    <h3 class="scm_h3">How it works.</h3>
    <p>
      SwimMeetClub keeps a log of all the race times swum by every member in
      your club. It could easily store hundreds of years of racing data.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's this racing data that SwimClubMeet uses to calculate the TimeToBeat.
      The more data there is, the better the results.
    </p>

    <p>
      TimeToBeat is always calculated based on the events swum up to but not
      including the current selected session. Future data, sessions which
      post-date the current select session, are excluded. If you select a
      session in the middle of SCM's stack of sessions, then all the sessions
      above it are ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one exception to the rules given above. When making Finals,
      Semi-Finals and Quarter-Finals the racetimes of the current selected
      session is considered. (Think about it, it makes sense ðŸ˜‰.)
    </p>

    <p>
      TimeToBeat is calculated actively, in real time. By default it uses the
      average of the 3 fastest times the member has swum. Alternatively it can
      use the last known race time or the member's personal best. You get to
      chose which one of these in the options dialogue.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a member doesn't have any race time data, then a time is calculated
      based on the mean average of the bottom 50% (default), with consideration
      to age and gender. You can turn this feature off in the option dialogue.
      Why you would do this - I don't know - perhaps you want to maually arrange
      swimmers new to the event? You might lower the percentage rate as you gain
      more race data. It's very dependant on the club demographics as to what is
      the perfect percentage.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there's still insufficient data, SCM will ignore gender and try once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is still not enough data (at least 4 records) then it will
      re-calculate, doing an age spread (plus or minus 1 year). There are
      currently no options for you to adjust minimum records and the spread
      values.
    </p>

    <p>
      If after all this, a suitable race time can't be found, then the
      TimeToBeat is left empty. This effectively places the swimmer in the
      slowest heats.
    </p>

    <h3 class="scm_h3">Auto-Build button.</h3>
    <p>This is what happens when you press the Auto-Build Heats button.</p>

    <p>
      TimeToBeat is used to select the heat and lane that a member will be
      given. In the moment that the Auto-Build button is pressed, all TTBs are
      calculated for all nominees for the given event, in real time. The data
      used is all the race times of all members that pre-dates the selected
      session. The TTB data is used to build a list of entrants, fastest to
      slowest. Those without a TTB will end at the bottom of this list and
      placed into the slowest heat. A new member, without a race history, may be
      incorrectly place for the first instance but once a race has been swum and
      their race time data is entered, that member will always be placed
      correctly.
