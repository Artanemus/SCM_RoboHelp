      Use the <span class="scm-mi">About</span> dialogue to see what SCM version you are

    <p>
      SwimClubMeet has been compiled as a 32bit application. This is due to the
      limitations of the VCL FastReports component used in SCM. It's hoped that
      future releases will be 64bit. All other support applications, not
      displaying reports, are compiled 64bit.
    </p>
    <p>SCM also includes ChangeLog.txt. View this file to see patch notes, bug fixes and changes. This is located in the application folder.</p>
    <p>The last vital bit of version control information is the SCM database version. Currently this can only be viewed using MSSMS.</p>
