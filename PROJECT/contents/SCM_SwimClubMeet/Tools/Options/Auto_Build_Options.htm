    <h3 class="SCM_h3">1. TimeToBeat (TTB) - Primary option</h3>
    <p>
      The time-to-beat determine which heat and lanes the entrant will be placed
      into. The TTB is calculated on demand.
    </p>
    <p>You have a pick of three algorithms.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px">
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‰ Use the last known race-time. SCM will excluding the current session
        when searching. If nothing is found. SCM uses the secondary option, if
        enabled.
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‰ Use the average of the 3 fastest race-times. The search excludes the
        current session and sessions that post dates the current. An average
        race-time is calculated. Finding only one record is acceptable. If none
        are found, SCM moves to the secondary option, if enabled
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‰ Use particpants personal best (PB). If nothing is found, SCM uses the
        secondary option, if enabled.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="SCM_h3">2. Entrants without race-times - Secondary option.</h3>
    <p>
      For entrants new to the event type, this algorithm will use brute force to
      find a race-time and calculate a TTB. The process goes like this...
    </p>
    <p>
      If a member doesn't have any race time data, then a time is calculated
      based on the mean average of the bottom 50% (default), with consideration
      to age and gender.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there's still insufficient data, SCM will ignore gender and try once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is still not enough data (at least 4 records) then it will
      re-calculate, doing an age spread (plus or minus 1 year). There are
      currently no options for you to adjust minimum records and the spread
      values.
    </p>

    <p>
      If after all this, a suitable race time can't be found, then the
      TimeToBeat is left empty. This effectively places the swimmer in the
      slowest heats.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <h3 class="SCM_h3">3. Gender and lane count</h3>
    <p>
      If <span class="SCM_MI">Seperate gender</span> is checked then there will
      be seperate heats for girls and boys. Said another way, boys will not race
      against girls. The order of the heats is slowest to fastest, with the girl
      swimming prior to the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      if <span class="SCM_MI">Exclude outside lanes</span> is checked then
      gutter lanes will not be used in events. If you have an eight lane pool,
      lane 1 and 8 will not be filled with swimmers. Helpful if your club is
      small and you want to run more heats, or if ladders obstruct the gutter
      lanes. It should be pointed out that all your pools lanes still appear in
      the lane grid, gutter exclusion on or off.
    </p>

    <h3 class="SCM_h3">4. Group by ...</h3>
    <p>Currently only two group types are defined.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px">
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‰ Entrant's age. Swimmers are placed into heats based on their age
        (calculated using the members DOB). Depending on club size, this may
        result in many heats with few participants in each heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‰ Entant's membership type. The membership table is inspected and the
        members are organised into heats based on type. This is one way to
        collectively gather swimmers into broad categories based on age. It's
        dependant on keeping the member's membership type up-to-date. An audit
        at the start of the each swimming season would be needed. Useful option for club championships.
      </p>

    </div>
    <p>Selecting <span class="SCM_MI">Don't group</span> disables grouping.</p>

    <h3 class="SCM_h3">5. Seed Method ...</h3>
    <p>A topic that has it's own page. To learn what seeding is and how it works, follow this <a href="../../System/How_seeding_works.htm">link</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Other miscellaneous notes ...</h3>
    <p>
      Changes made in this dialogue are remembered next time you use the tool.
      Individual events don't store snap-shots of these settings when auto-build is
      enacted. There is only one set of parameters and it's up to you to manage it state (spoken like a programmer).
