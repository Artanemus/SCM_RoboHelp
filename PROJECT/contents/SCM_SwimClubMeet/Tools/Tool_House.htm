      Create, delete houses. Edit house names, motto, color, logo, etc. Assign
      members to houses. Print house reports.

    <h3 class="scm_h3">What the point of houses in SCM?</h3>
    <p>
      The answer is none. Swimming Clubs don't need houses to run club-nights.
      Using houses would complicate the meet, add more work and have little
      gain.

    <!-- HOUSE DETAIL -->
    <h3 class="scm_h3">Houses Details - Tab-Sheet</h3>
    <p>
      Houses are a work-in-progress and have been placed in the release version
      to encourage a little exploration and experimentation for its users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Houses are used by the SCM_LeaderBoard application. Very useful if you
      were a school trying to run a swimming carnival. Not that SCM is designed
      or intended to be used for this purpose.ðŸ˜‰
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px">
      <span style="font-style: italic"
        >DEVELOPER : I get asked all the time - can it be used for school
        carnivals? For which I reply, no. But secretly that's not the case. Stay
        tuned.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      On first install, SCM has placed some starter data into the house table.
      Consider this data as examples. You'll discover four houses have been
      created. You can navigate these houses using the navigation bar placed at
      the bottom of the dialogue.

            Picture format for the logo is JPEG, BMP, SVG. Recommended size is
            800x800 pixels square.

            <p>
              The house members table lists all of the club members who have been
              assigned to this house. This table is read only. To enter a member
              to a house, you must use the Members Dialogue. Here you'll find a
              house dropdown combo-box in the Members Details Tab-Sheet and in the
              Members List Tab-Sheet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use the search box to find a member - should the list be very
              long.
            </p>
            <p>The Navigation bar enables delete and insert of new houses.</p>
            <p>
              Future versions will including a special tool to 'Auto-Assign'
              members to a house. This will be based on a weighted algorithm
              that will create an even spread of age, gender, and performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              To see a House leader-board score use the SCM_LeaderBoard application. House
              scores can also be printed in this app.

            Currently there is only one report available.
            <p>This report will print a list of members for each house.</p>
            <p>
              Future version will include a more comprehensive selection of
              reports. This is a work in progress.
