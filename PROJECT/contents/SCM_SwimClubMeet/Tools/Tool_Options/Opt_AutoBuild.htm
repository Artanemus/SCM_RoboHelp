    <!-- GENDER AND LANES -->
    <h3 class="scm_h3">Gender and lane count</h3>
    <p>
      If <span class="scm_mi">Seperate gender</span> is checked then there will
      be seperate heats for each gender. ie. Boys will not race against girls.
      The order of the heats is slowest to fastest, with the girl swimming prior
      to the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      if <span class="scm_mi">Exclude outside lanes</span> is checked then
      gutter lanes will not be used in events. If you have an eight lane pool,
      lane 1 and 8 will not be filled with swimmers. Helpful if your club is
      small and you want to run more heats, or if ladders obstruct the gutter
      lanes. It should be pointed out that all your pools lanes still appear in
      the lane grid, gutter exclusion on or off.

    <!-- GROUP BY -->
    <h3 class="scm_h3">Group by ...</h3>
    <p>Currently only two group types are defined.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px">
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‰ Entrant's age. Swimmers are placed into heats based on their age
        (calculated using the members DOB). Depending on club size, this may
        result in many heats with few participants in each heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‰ Entant's membership type. The membership table is inspected and the
        members are organised into heats based on type. This is one way to
        collectively gather swimmers into broad categories based on age. It's
        dependant on keeping the member's membership type up-to-date. An audit
        at the start of the each swimming season would be needed. Useful option
        for club championships.
      </p>

    <p>
      Changes made in this dialogue are remembered next time you use the tool.
      Individual events don't store snap-shots of these settings when auto-build
      is enacted. There is only one set of parameters and it's up to you to
      manage its state.
