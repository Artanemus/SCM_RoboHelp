    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Club Name and Club Nickname</h3>
    <p>
      These values are used in all reports. In future versions of SCM, they will
      be used as verification data for user login to the official SCM website.
    </p>

    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Number of lanes</h3>
    <p>
      Any number of lanes can be entered. When printing out marshall and
      timekeeper reports, 10 lanes can comfortable fit a standard A4 page. Use
      the <span class="SCM_MI">Exclude Gutter Lanes</span> option in <span class="SCM_MI">Auto-Build</span> tab to ignore outside
      lanes that may contain obstacles, such as ladders and grates.
    </p>

    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Pool length</h3>
    <p>Any pool length will be accepted.</p>
    <p>
      Note:
      <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="Default_SCM_" href="#">SCM </a>has
      qualification 'tables' for two pool length,
      <span class="SCM_Term">Short Course</span> (25m) and
      <span class="SCM_Term">Olympic Standard or Long Course</span> (50m). SCM
      will auto-matically determine which table to used based on what is entered
      here. If your swimming pool doesn't conform to these two lengths, any pool
      longer than 33.3 yards (30.4m) is considered a long course pool. This
      means most olympic diving pools will be short course pools.
    </p>

    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Season Starts</h3>
    <p>
      In Australia the summer season starts in October.The date given here is
      used in auditing and calculating members age. When scoring (for the
      leader-board) you can specify the swimmers age as of session date or
      season start. Auto-Build heats uses start of session for swimmers
      age. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="SCM_h3">Email, Contact Number, Website.</h3>
