    <h3 class="scm_h3">TimeToBeat algorithm</h3>

    <!-- TIMETOBEAT -->
    <h3 class="scm_h3">TimeToBeat (TTB) - Primary option</h3>
    <p>
      The time-to-beat determine which heat and lanes the entrant will be placed
      into. The TTB is calculated on demand.
    </p>
    <p>You have a pick of three algorithms.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px">
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‰ Use the last known race-time. SCM will excluding the current session
        when searching. If nothing is found. SCM uses the secondary option, if
        enabled.
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‰ Use the average of the 3 fastest race-times. The search excludes the
        current session and sessions that post dates the current. An average
        race-time is calculated. Finding only one record is acceptable. If none
        are found, SCM moves to the secondary option, if enabled
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‰ Use particpants personal best (PB). If nothing is found, SCM uses the
        secondary option, if enabled. Else the entrant is placed in the slowest
        heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless specified, TTB is calculated from data that pre-dates the current
        selected session.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ENTRANTS WITH NO RACETIMES -->
    <h3 class="scm_h3">Members without race-times - Secondary option.</h3>
    <p>
      For entrants new to the event type, this algorithm will use brute force to
      find a race-time and calculate a TTB. The process goes like this...
    </p>
    <p>
      If a member doesn't have any race time data, then a time is calculated
      based on the mean average of the bottom 50% (default), with consideration
      to age and gender.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there's still insufficient data, SCM will ignore gender and try once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is still not enough data (at least 4 records) then it will
      re-calculate, doing an age spread (plus or minus 1 year). There are
      currently no options for you to adjust minimum records and the spread
      values.
    </p>

    <p>
      If after all this, a suitable race time can't be found, then the
      TimeToBeat is left empty. This effectively places the swimmer in the
      slowest heats.
