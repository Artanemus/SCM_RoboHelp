    <!-- WHAT ARE QUALIFICATION TIMES -->
    <h3 class="scm-h3">What are qualification times?</h3>
    <p>
      Qualification Times (QT) are the minimum swimming times allowed for a
      given distance and stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      A swimmer must be able to complete the event within the QT, else the
      swimmer is ineligible to swim that event.
    </p>
    <p>QT are age and gender specific.</p>
    <p>
      SCM uses separate QT tables for short and long course. What table you see
      is dependant on your clubs
      <span class="scm-mi">length of pool</span> settings. Pools 30.4m or less
      (33yards) are considered short courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      When SCM is first installed it fills both long course and short course
      data into the table. That way, right out of the box, you can use the
      feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you intend to make changes to this table, please remember that SCM
      requires you to enter data for all genders.
    </p>

    <!-- WHERE IS THE TABLE -->
    <h3 class="scm-h3">Where do I find this table?</h3>
    <p>Go to the menu bar and follow the bread crumbs ...</p>

    <!-- WHERE IS IT USED -->

            In the Nominate tabsheet there is a Qualify toggle button.
            <p>
              When you enable this button, the letter 'Q' appears prefix next to
              each event a club member is qualified to swim.
            </p>

            <p>Other instances include...</p>
            <p>
              Qualification is flagged in the Self-Nominate support application.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Pre-Nomination support application, it flags qualification
              when it emails each members a PDF nomination form.
            </p>
            <p>Various reports also display the qualification status.</p>
            <p>The SCM_Carnival application can exclude participants from entering events they are not qualified to swim.</p>

        Info: Most swimming clubs don't use qualification times for 25m events.
        On first install, SCM doesn't provide the table information for this distance.
        If you need it, simply add it.
