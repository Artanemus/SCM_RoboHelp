  <h2 class="SCM_h2">Qualify Times</h2>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">What are qualification times?</h3>
  <p>Qualification Times (QT) are the minimum swimming times allowed for a given distance and stroke.</p>
  <p>A swimmer must be able to complete the event within the QT, else the swimmer is ineligible to swim that event.</p>
  <p>QT are age and gender specific.</p>
  <p>SCM uses seperate QT tabels for short and long course. What table you see is dependant on your clubs <span class="SCM_MenuItem">length of pool</span> settings.  Pools 30.4m or less (33yards) are considered short courses.</p>
  <p>SCM requires all genders to be entered.</p>

  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Where are qualification times used in SCM?</h3>
  <p>When you nominate an entrant you have the option to turn on the &#39;qualifyied&#39; button, or &#39;Q&#39; button. The letter &#39;Q&#39; appears next to each event a club member is qualified to swim. Qualification is flagged in the Nominate support app. Also the pre-nomination flags qualification when it emails each members a PDF nomination form. Various reports display the qualification status of members.</p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Keyboard Short-cuts.</h3>
  <p><span class="SCM_Keyboard">cntrl-DEL</span> for delete record.</p>
  <p><span class="SCM_Keyboard">cntrl-Ins</span> to insert a new record.</p>
  <h3 class="SCM_h3">Other bits.</h3>
  <p>Most swimming clubs don&#39;t use qualification times for 25m events. 25m events are open to all swimmers. I guess you would need a 15m trial distance to make a 25m qualification record?</p>
