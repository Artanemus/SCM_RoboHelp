         Tip:
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are running in paperless mode, that is, your are using the
        support applications <span class="scm-term">SCM_Marshal</span> and
        <span class="scm-term">SCM_Timekeeper</span> , it's good to instigate
        some pool procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        A heat is considered <span class="scm-quote">raced</span> when the
        Referee blows the whistle. The Chief Marshal or Referee can set the heat
        status to <span class="scm-quote">raced </span> by using the
        <span class="scm-term">SCM_Marshal</span> application..
      </p>
      <p>
        A heat is considered <span class="scm-quote">closed</span> when all the
        race time data has been entered into the database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Race-times can be entered by the Chief Timekeeper at the poolside by
        using the <span class="scm-term">SCM_Timekeeper</span> application. They
        can't <span class="scm-quote">close</span> the heat, only the core
        application can do that.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the Referee flags the heat is over the Chief Recorder does an
        Q&amp;A and then <span class="scm-quote">closes</span> the heat.
      </p>
