  <p>Only nominee&#39;s that have nominated for the event and haven&#39;t been given a lane are shown in this dialogue.</p>
  <p>Personal Best and TimeToBeat are calculated &#39;on-the-fly&#39;. The times shown are based on data that pre-dates the current selected session. Personal Best will be empty if the nominee hasn&#39;t previously swum the event. TimeToBeat will be empty if there is insufficient data.</p>
  <p>Click on a column heading to sort on that column. Click again to invert the sort.</p>
  <p>The dialogue also includes a search textbox to filter the list. This uses wildcards. You only need to type a &#39;snippet&#39;. It filters the list as you type.</p>
  <p>By default names are described lastname, firstname. This can be switched by  pressing the toggle-name button.</p>
  <p>This dialogue will be empty if all nominees have been placed (they have a swimming lane).</p>
  <p>The information found here should assist you in manually building a heat.</p>
  <p>Note the title bar reads <span class="SCM_Quotes">Nominees</span>, the first column&#39;s is titled <span class="SCM_Quotes">Nominees</span>.</p>

  <h2 class="SCM_h2"><a data-indexterm="Quick Pick" id="Quick_Pick"></a><a id="QuickPickMember"></a>Quick Pick Member</h2>
  <p>Lists all active members (who are active and swim), EXCLUDING those that are currently assigned a lane in the current event.  </p>
  <p>All the notes for the nominee dialogue pertain to this dialogue.</p>
  <p>Just one important note. When you select a member from this list, that member will become a nominee for the event AND an entrant.</p>
  <p>A possible reason to use the &#39;Quick Pick Member&#39; method is : A member in your club has arrived very late. Nominations for events have closed but they want to swim this event. Using this method you perform both nomination and assign them a lane. With the ability to see their racetimes, you can pick the right heat/lane for them ... all this without performing an auto-build.</p>
  <p>This list can be large. Larger than the nominee&#39;s list.</p>
  <p>Note the title bar reads <span class="SCM_Quotes">Active Members</span>, the first column is titled <span class="SCM_Quotes">Members&#39; Name</span>.</p>
